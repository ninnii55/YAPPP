      "Adult T cell leukaemia / lymphoma (ATLL) is a mature (post thymic) T cell lymphoma caused by the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. Overall survival in the aggressive subtypes (Acute Leukaemia and Lymphomatous) remains poor in part due to chemotherapy resistance. To improve treatment outcome for de novo disease, better induction therapies are required and since the pathogenic agent is known it would seem sensible to target the virus. In a recent meta-analysis the use of zidovudine and interferon alpha (ZDV/IFN) has been associated with improved response rates and prolonged overall survival in leukemic subtypes of ATLL (both acute and Chronic) confirmed in a multivariate analysis. In a more recent UK study the overall response rate for patients with aggressive ATLL treated with chemotherapy alone was 49Â % compared to 81Â % with combined first line therapy (chemotherapy with concurrent or sequential ZDV/IFN). Combined first line therapy prolonged median OS in acute (pâ=â0.0081) and lymphomatous ATLL (pâ=â0.001).These data support the use of low dose ZDV/IFN with chemotherapy as first line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed aggressive ATLL. Although the mechanisms of action are incompletely understood, some possible explanations for their efficacy will be discussed.\n",
      "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are widely used for multiple types of malignancies and are considered the fourth pillar in cancer treatment. Anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab are approved for relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Nonetheless, two phase 2 trials for T-cell lymphoma were terminated because of hyperprogression after a single dose in some patients.In this review, we summarize available information on the rapid progression of peripheral T-cell lymphoma including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL).In the abovementioned two trials, disease subtypes in patients who experienced hyperprogression were mostly ATLL or angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Possible hyperprogression mechanisms induced by PD-1 blockade are the compensatory upregulation of the expression of other checkpoints, altered expression of lymphoma-promoting growth factors, functional blockade of stromal PD-ligand 1 acting as a tumor suppressor, and unique immune environment in indolent ATLL. The differentiation between hyperprogression and pseudoprogression is practically essential. There are no established methods to predict hyperprogression before administration of an ICI. In the future, the progress of novel diagnostic modalities such as positron emission tomography with computed tomography and circulating tumor DNA is expected to facilitate early cancer detection.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive T-cell malignancy with a poor prognosis with current therapy. Here we report genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening of ATLL models, which identified CDK6, CCND2, BATF3, JUNB, STAT3, and IL10RB as genes that are essential for the proliferation and/or survival of ATLL cells. As a single agent, the CDK6 inhibitor palbociclib induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ATLL models with wild-type TP53. ATLL models that had inactivated TP53 genetically were relatively resistant to palbociclib owing to compensatory CDK2 activity, and this resistance could be reversed by APR-246, a small molecule activator of mutant TP53. The CRISPR-Cas9 screen further highlighted the dependence of ATLL cells on mTORC1 signaling. Treatment of ATLL cells with palbociclib in combination with mTORC1 inhibitors was synergistically toxic irrespective of the TP53 status. This work defines CDK6 as a novel therapeutic target for ATLL and supports the clinical evaluation of palbociclib in combination with mTORC1 inhibitors in this recalcitrant malignancy.\n",
      "HIV and HTLV (Human T-ymphotropic Virus) are the only known retroviruses responsible for causing infection in humans. HTLV-1 and HIV-1 are frequent co-pathogens, however, despite its potential for accelerated progression of HIV disease and the risk of developing adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL), HTLV-1 is seldom considered for investigation in the HIV-1 positive individual. Severe/refractory hypercalcaemia, unresponsive to conventional calcium lowering therapy may complicate up to 70% of cases of ATLL. In addition, HTLV-1 and ATLL have both been associated with a rise in dysfunctional CD4 lymphocytes, thereby conveying a false sense of immune competence in the HIV-1 infected individual.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a peripheral T-cell malignancy caused by human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I. Clinical manifestations of ATLL range from smoldering to chronic, lymphoma and acute. Patients with acute and lymphoma type ATLL require therapeutic intervention. Conventional chemotherapeutic regimens used against other malignant lymphoma have been administered to ATLL patients, but the therapeutic outcomes of acute and lymphoma type ATLL remain very poor. Promising results of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for ATLL patients have recently been reported and the treatment outcome might be improved for some ATLL patients. Besides conventional chemotherapy and SCT, interferon, zidovudine, arsenic trioxide, targeted therapy against surface molecule on ATLL cells, retinoid derivatives, and bortezomib have been administered to ATLL patients in pilot or phase I/II studies. Further studies are required to confirm the clinical benefits of these novel therapeutics. This article reviews the current status and future directions of ATLL treatment.\n",
      "Mogamulizumab (MOG), a humanized anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) monoclonal antibody, has recently played an important role in the treatment of adult TÂ cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Because CCR4 is expressed on normal regulatory TÂ cells as well as on ATLL cells, MOG may accelerate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) by eradicating regulatory TÂ cells in patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). However, there is limited information about its safety and efficacy in patients treated with MOG before allo-HSCT. In the present study, 25 patients with ATLL were treated with MOG before allo-HSCT, after which 18 patients (72%) achieved remission. The overall survival and progression-free survival at 1Â year post-transplantation were 20.2% (95% CI, 6.0% to 40.3%) and 15.0% (95% CI, 4.3% to 32.0%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD was 64.0% (95% CI, 40.7% to 80.1%) for grade II-IV and 34.7% (95% CI, 15.8% to 54.4%) for grade III-IV. The cumulative incidence of transplantation-related mortality (TRM) was 49.0% (95% CI, 27.0% to 67.8%). Six of 7 patients with acute GVHD grade III-IV died from GVHD, which was the leading cause of death. In particular, a shorter interval from the last administration of MOG to allo-HSCT was associated with more severe GVHD. MOG use before allo-HSCT may decrease the ATLL burden; however, it is associated with an increase in TRM due to severe GVHD. Because MOG is a potent anti-ATLL agent, new treatment protocols should be developed to integrate MOG at suitable doses and timing of administration to minimize unwanted GVHD development.Copyright Â© 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a malignancy caused by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Aggressive ATLL is refractory to conventional chemotherapy and has a poor prognosis. Better therapeutic approaches, including cancer immunotherapy, are required to improve survival and prognosis. The genetic landscape of ATLL reveals frequent genetic alterations in genes associated with immune surveillance, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, CD58 antigen, and programmed cell death ligand 1. Clinicopathological investigations also revealed tumor immunity mechanisms in ATLL, including immune checkpoint molecules, MHC molecules, tumor-associated macrophages, and chemokines. However, the tumor microenvironment of ATLL remains complex because ATLL itself originates from T-cells, usually expressing regulatory T-cell markers. In this review, we discuss the recent literature describing the tumor microenvironment of ATLL.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive malignancy of CD4+ T lymphocytes caused by human T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infection. HTLV-1 was brought to the World Health Organization (WHO) and researchers to address its impact on global public health, oncogenicity, and deterioration of the host immune system toward autoimmunity. In a minority of the infected population (3-5%), it can induce inflammatory networks toward HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), or hijacking the infected CD4+ T lymphocytes into T regulatory subpopulation, stimulating anti-inflammatory signaling networks, and prompting ATLL development. This review critically discusses the complex signaling networks in ATLL pathogenesis during virus-host interactions for better interpretation of oncogenicity and introduces the main candidates in the pathogenesis of ATLL. At least two viral factors, HTLV-1 trans-activator protein (TAX) and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ), are implicated in ATLL manifestation, interacting with host responses and deregulating cell signaling in favor of infected cell survival and virus dissemination. Such molecules can be used as potential novel biomarkers for ATLL prognosis or targets for therapy. Moreover, the challenging aspects of HTLV-1 oncogenesis introduced in this review could open new venues for further studies on acute leukemia pathogenesis. These features can aid in the discovery of effective immunotherapies when reversing the gene expression profile toward appropriate immune responses gradually becomes attainable.\n",
      "Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a CD4-positive peripheral T cell lymphoma caused by human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Although ATLL is quite difficult to be cured, up-regulation of cellular immunity such as HTLV-1 Tax-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) has been proved to be important to obtain long-term survival. At present, no efficacious method to activate ATLL-specific cellular immunity is available. This study aimed to investigate whether live attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccination to ATLL can activate HTLV-1 Tax-specific cellular immune response. A total of 3 indolent- and 3 aggressive-type ATLL patients were enrolled. All aggressive-type patients had the VZV vaccination after completing anti-ATLL treatment including mogamulizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody for C-C chemokine receptor 4 antigen, plus combination chemotherapy, whereas all indolent-type patients had the VZV vaccination without any antitumor treatment. Cellular immune responses including Tax-specific CTLs were analyzed at several time points of pre- and post-VZV vaccination. After the VZV vaccination, a moderate increase in 1 of 3 indolent-type patients and obvious increase in all 3 aggressive-type patients in Tax-specific CTLs percentage were observed. The increase in the cell-mediated immunity against VZV was observed in all indolent- and aggressive-type patients after VZV vaccination. To conclude, VZV vaccination to aggressive-type ATLL patients after mogamulizumab plus chemotherapy led to the up-regulation of HTLV-1 Tax-specific CTLs without any adverse event. Suppression of regulatory T lymphocytes by mogamulizumab may have contributed to increase tumor immunity in aggressive-type ATLL patients.

      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an extremely refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma that develops after persistent human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. In recent years, the number of HTLV-1 carriers has decreased due to lifestyle changes and different measures. Rapid progression in comprehensive genetic analysis techniques has revealed the molecular basis of ATL. Therefore, in addition to conventional prognostic indices based on clinical parameters, prognostic indices incorporating genetic mutations have been proposed. The standard treatment for untreated aggressive ATL is combination chemotherapy such as VCAP-AMP-VECP or CHOP, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as appropriate. Combined mogamulizumab and chemotherapy is a promising first-line treatment option for patients not eligible for transplantation. Salvage treatment with lenalidomide, brentuximab vedotin, tucidinostat, and valemetostat, in addition to mogamulizumab, has been introduced over the last decade. Advancements in allogeneic transplantation therapy, including early induction and transplantation with post-transplant cyclophosphamide for GVHD prophylaxis, have also improved patient outcomes. This article highlights recent developments in the field of ATL.\n",
      "A classification for adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) based on clinical features was proposed in 1991: acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types, and their median survival times (MSTs) were reported to be 6.2, 10.2, 24.3 months, and not reached, respectively. Several new therapies for ATL have since been developed, i.e. dose-intensity multi-agent chemotherapies, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), monoclonal antibodies, and anti-viral therapy. The monoclonal antibody to CCR4, mogamulizumab, clearly improved response rates in patients with treatment-naÃ¯ve and relapsed aggressive ATL, and has the potential to provide a survival advantage. The outcomes of allo-HSCT have been reported since the early 2000s. High treatment-related mortality was initially the crucial issue associated with this treatment approach; however, reduced intensity conditioning regimens have decreased the risk of treatment-related mortality. The introduction of allo- HSCT has had a positive impact on the prognosis of and potential curability with treatments for ATL. A meta-analysis of a treatment with interferon-Î± and zidovudine (IFN/AZT) revealed a survival benefit in patients with the leukemic subtype. A phase 3 study comparing IFN/AZT with watchful waiting in patients with indolent ATL is ongoing in Japan. Several clinical trials on novel agents are currently being conducted, such as the histone deacetylase inhibitors, alemtuzumab, brentuximab vedotin, nivolumab, and an EZH1/2 dual inhibitor.\n",
      "Mogamulizumab, a defucosylated humanized monoclonal antibody against the C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), has been approved for the treatment of relapsed adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). Compared with conventional chemotherapy, mogamulizumab monotherapy displayed more efficacy in relapsed ATL, making mogamulizumab a promising therapeutic agent. However, mogamulizumab could increase graft-versus-host disease, resulting in poor survival outcome in the allogenic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) setting. It is possible that the efficacy of mogamulizumab could be established by the occurrence of skin rashes and/or CCR4 mutational status. Hence, this study reviews the current treatment strategies for patients with ATL and focuses on the safety and efficacy (single-agent and combined with chemotherapy or allo-SCT) of mogamulizumab.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a rare, aggressive subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma developing after many years of chronic, asymptomatic infection with the retrovirus human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 is endemic to certain geographic areas of the world, and primary infection generally occurs in infancy through mother-to-child transmission via breastfeeding. In less than 5% of infected individuals, a decades-long pathogenic process culminates in the development of ATL. Aggressive subtypes of ATL are life-threatening and challenging to treat, with median overall survival typically less than 1 year in the absence of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Owing to the rarity of this illness, prospective large-scale clinical trials have been challenging to perform, and treatment recommendations are largely founded upon limited evidence. Herein, we review the current therapeutic options for ATL, providing a broad literature overview of the foremost clinical trials and reports of this disease. We emphasize our own treatment paradigm, which is broadly based upon disease subtype, patient fitness, and intent to perform alloHCT. Finally, we highlight recent advances in understanding ATL disease biology and important ongoing clinical trials that we foresee as informative and potentially practice-changing.Â© 2023.

      "Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL) is an aggressive malignant disease of CD4+ T-cells associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). Prognosis of ATL patients is directly correlated to the subtype of ATL. Treatment of the aggressive forms (acute and lymphoma types) of ATL remains inadequate, as most ATL patients receive conventional chemotherapy without stem cell rescue. At present, LSG15 is the standard chemotherapy for the treatment of aggressive ATL, but the efficacy of LSG15 in most patients is transient. To prolong median survival time, additional therapies for maintenance of complete response (CR) are needed after achieving CR by induction chemotherapy. Improved outcome after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), despite a high incidence of graft-versus-host disease, has been reported. Thus, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and allogeneic peripheral blood SCT may have great potential for eradication of HTLV-1 and cure of ATL. Recently, reduced-intensity conditioning stem cell transplantation was also reported to be effective for ATL. Although several issues, including selection criteria for patients and sources of stem cells remain to be resolved, allo-SCT may be considered as a treatment option for patients with aggressive ATL. To evaluate whether allo-SCT is more effective than the standard chemotherapy (LSG15) for aggressive ATL, an up front phase II clinical trial of JCOG-LSG is now being planned. Novel innovative targeted strategies, such as antiretroviral therapy, arsenic trioxide, nuclear factor-kappaB inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, several monoclonal antibodies including anti-CC chemokine receptor 4, anti-folate, purine nucleotide phosphorylase inhibitor, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor, bendamustine, small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitors and Tax-targeted immunotherapy, should be promptly studied in order to develop curative treatments for ATL in the near future.\n",
      "The prognosis of aggressive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is poor, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a curative treatment. In order to identify favorable prognostic patients after intensive chemotherapy, and who therefore might not require upfront allo-HSCT, we aimed to improve risk stratification of aggressive ATL patients aged <70 years. The clinical risk factors and genetic mutations were incorporated into risk modeling for overall survival (OS). We generated the m7-ATLPI, a clinicogenetic risk model for OS, that included the ATL prognostic index (PI) (ATL-PI) risk category, and non-silent mutations in seven genes, namely TP53, IRF4, RHOA, PRKCB, CARD11, CCR7, and GATA3. In the training cohort of 99 patients, the m7-ATLPI identified a low-, intermediate-, and highrisk group with 2-year OS of 100%, 43%, and 19%, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] =5.46; P<0.0001). The m7-ATLPI achieved superior risk stratification compared to the current ATL-PI (C-index 0.92 vs. 0.85, respectively). In the validation cohort of 84 patients, the m7-ATLPI defined low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups with a 2-year OS of 81%, 30%, and 0%, respectively (HR=2.33; P=0.0094), and the model again outperformed the ATL-PI (C-index 0.72 vs. 0.70, respectively). The simplified m7-ATLPI, which is easier to use in clinical practice, achieved superior risk stratification compared to the ATLPI, as did the original m7-ATLPI; the simplified version was calculated by summing the following: high-risk ATL-PI category (+10), low-risk ATL-PI category (-4), and non-silent mutations in TP53 (+4), IRF4 (+3), RHOA (+1), PRKCB (+1), CARD11 (+0.5), CCR7 (-2), and GATA3 (-3).\n",
      "To discuss current understanding of the mechanisms of human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) tumorigenesis and current and potential treatment strategies for adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL), an aggressive malignant disease of CD4 cells caused by HTLV-1.Treatment of the aggressive subtypes of ATL remains inadequate, with little improvement in overall survival in the 30 years since HTLV-1 was discovered. Detailed analysis of the clonal expansion of HTLV-1 has provided new insight into pathogenesis. Most HTLV-1-infected cells, including ATL, express CCR4 which can be targeted. Reports of antitumour effects with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation provide a rationale for novel immunotherapy approaches. Progress has been made in the indolent subtypes of ATL with the use of 'antiviral' therapies.ATL has poor prognosis. There is a major, urgent, unmet clinical need to identify HTLV carriers who will develop ATL to develop biomarkers of transforming disease and disease progression and to provide novel treatment approaches within the context of clinical trials. Several strategies now include putative or actual antiviral therapy. Potentially, the risk of ATL would be reduced by eliminating some or all infected clones. HTLV-1 infection, and hence ATL, can be prevented by antenatal HTLV-1 screening.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), an infrequent malignancy resultant from human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1), exhibits a spectrum of phenotypes, encompassing acute, smoldering, lymphomatous, and chronic variants, each bearing distinct clinical presentations. The preponderant acute manifestation is characterized by hypercalcemia, systemic manifestations, organomegaly, and dermatological eruptions. Conversely, the chronic phenotype is typified by lymphocytosis and/or cutaneous eruptions, while smoldering ATLL assumes an asymptomatic course. Immunocompromise afflicts ATLL patients, heightening their vulnerability to opportunistic infections that frequently intricately intertwine with disease progression. Therefore, an early diagnosis is crucial to manage the disease appropriately. While conventional chemotherapeutic regimens have shown limited success, especially in acute and lymphoma types, recent studies suggest that allogeneic stem cell transplantation might enhance treatment results because it has shown promising outcomes in some patients. Novel therapeutics, such as interferon and monoclonal antibodies, have also shown promise, but more research is needed to confirm their efficacy. Moreover, the identification of biomarkers for ATLL and genetic changes in HTLV-1 infected cells has led to the development of targeted therapies that have shown remarkable success in clinical trials. These targeted therapies have the potential to offer a more personalized approach to the treatment of ATLL. The aim of our review is to elaborate on conventional and novel therapies and the efficiency of mentioned treatments.Â© 2023.

      "Of the millions of HTLV-1 infected carriers worldwide, 3-5% will develop an aggressive T-cell neoplasm that is highly refractory to conventional therapy. The virus carries the Tax oncogene which constitutively activates the NFÎºB pathway. This co-option of signaling through NFÎºB provides for the HTLV-1 infected cell an escape from cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, a steady source of growth factors, and a mechanism by which the virus can activate its own target cell. Therapies that target the NFÎºB pathway sensitize adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cells to apoptosis. A focus on translational interrogation of NFÎºB inhibitors in animal models and ATLL patients is needed to advance NFÎºB-targeted ATLL therapies to the bedside.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is a peripheral T-lymphocyte malignancy caused by an RNA retrovirus, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. ATL is clinically classified into four disease subtypes. The acute, lymphoma type, and cases of the chronic type involving unfavorable prognostic factors are regarded as aggressive ATL subtypes that require immediate treatment. Dose-intensified chemotherapy, such as the VCAP-AMP-VECP regimen, is considered to be the most recommended treatment for aggressive ATL. However, ATL remains difficult to cure and has an extremely poor prognosis, even when such chemotherapy is employed. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only known curative therapy and is recommended for younger patients with aggressive ATL. However, because of the increasing age at the onset of ATL, only a small fraction of patients with ATL can benefit from such transplants; therefore, there is an unmet medical need for novel drugs. Mogamulizumab, a defucosylated, humanized anti-C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) monoclonal antibody, was developed using a novel glycoengineering technique. Mogamulizumab monotherapy achieved clinically meaningful effects in patients with relapsed aggressive ATL and has exhibited acceptable toxicity profiles both inside and outside of Japan. In addition, lenalidomide has shown promising antitumor activity in patients with ATL. Furthermore, based on the results of translational research, several promising novel agents are currently being investigated and might contribute to improving the prognosis of ATL.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) patients have an extremely poor prognosis, partly due to their immunosuppressive state. The majority of ATLL patients have leukemic cells with phenotype similar to Tregs, prompting suggestions that ATLL cells themselves have immunosuppressive functions. In this study, we detected CD39 expression on ATLL cells, particularly frequent on aggressive subtypes. CD39 and CD73 convert extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into adenosine, a key player in Tregs' immunosuppression. In vitro culture, both CD39+ ATLL cells and normal Tregs converted rapidly extracellular ATP to AMP, which was disturbed by CD39 inhibitors, and was negated in the CD39 knockout MJ cell line. The proliferation of cocultured CD4+/CD8+ normal T cells was suppressed by CD39+ MJ cells, but not by CD39 knockout MJ cells. Supplemented ATP was exhausted by an EG7-OVA T-cell line with stable CD39 induction, but not by mock. When these cell lines were subcutaneously transplanted into murine flanks, Poly(I:C) peritoneal administration reduced tumor size to 1/3 in mock-transplanted tumors, but not in CD39 induced tumors. Overall, we found that ATLL cells express CD39 at a high rate, and our results suggest that this helps ATLL cells escape antitumor immunity through the extracellular ATPDase-Adenosine cascade. These findings will guide future clinical strategies for ATLL treatment.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL) is a rare T cell neoplasm that is endemic in Japanese, Caribbean, and Latin American populations. Most North American ATLL patients are of Caribbean descent and are characterized by high rates of chemo-refractory disease and worse prognosis compared with Japanese ATLL. To determine genomic differences between these 2 cohorts, we performed targeted exon sequencing on 30 North American ATLL patients and compared the results with the Japanese ATLL cases. Although the frequency of TP53 mutations was comparable, the mutation frequency in epigenetic and histone modifying genes (57%) was significantly higher, whereas the mutation frequency in JAK/STAT and T-cell receptor/NF-ÎºB pathway genes was significantly lower. The most common type of epigenetic mutation is that affecting EP300 (20%). As a category, epigenetic mutations were associated with adverse prognosis. Dissimilarities with the Japanese cases were also revealed by RNA sequencing analysis of 9 primary patient samples. ATLL samples with a mutated EP300 gene have decreased total and acetyl p53 protein and a transcriptional signature reminiscent of p53-mutated cancers. Most importantly, decitabine has highly selective single-agent activity in the EP300-mutated ATLL samples, suggesting that decitabine treatment induces a synthetic lethal phenotype in EP300-mutated ATLL cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that North American ATLL has a distinct genomic landscape that is characterized by frequent epigenetic mutations that are targetable preclinically with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.Â© 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a fatal disease caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). We retrospectively analyzed 195 patients with ATLL (lymphomatous n = 96, acute n = 80, unfavorable chronic n = 7, chronic n = 5, smoldering n = 3, and unclassified n = 4) diagnosed between 1987 and 2016 (median age 52 years, 77% Afro-Caribbean). Hypercalcemia was associated with acute ATLL (65%, vs 23% lymphomatous) (P = .012). The median survival for patients treated with modern therapies between 2000 and 2016 was 4.1 months for acute, 10.2 months for lymphomatous, 72 months for chronic/smoldering, and not reached for unfavorable chronic type, with 4-year survival rates of 10%, 4%, 60%, and 83%, respectively. The overall response rate (ORR) after first-line multiagent chemotherapy was 78% (complete response [CR] 39%) for acute vs 67% (CR 33%) for lymphomatous ATLL. First-line zidovudine interferon-Î± (AZT-IFN) resulted in ORR of 56% (CR 23%) for acute (n = 43), 33% (CR 16.5%) for lymphomatous (n = 6), and 86% (CR 29%) for unfavorable chronic ATLL. The median progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with aggressive ATLL who achieved CR after AZT-IFN was 48 months vs 11 months after chemotherapy (P = .003). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) resulted in a PFS of 24 and 28 months in 2 patients with lymphomatous ATLL. Our results suggest high-dose AZT-IFN is a reasonable up-front option for patients with aggressive leukemic ATLL followed by chemotherapy switch in nonresponders, whereas chemotherapy should be used in lymphomatous type followed by allo-HSCT when feasible.Â© 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.\n",
      "Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is endemic in southern Japan, the Caribbean, intertropical Africa, and Brazil. Recently north east Iran, particularly the region of Mashhad, has been recognized as a new endemic region. ATLL is an aggressive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Patients with ATLL have high plasma levels of VEGF that induce angiogenesis. Prognosis of ATLL remains poor because of immunosuppression and intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy. Important advances in the treatment of ATLL were reported with the combination of zidovudine (AZT) and interferon-alpha. We investigated the effect of AZT/IFN treatment on vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) plasma levels and HTLV-I proviral load in ATLL patients from the region of Mashhad. We confirmed that AZT/IFN treatment induces a high response rate and prolonged survival with minimal side effects. We also confirmed that VEGF plasma levels and HTLV-I proviral load are higher in ATLL patients than in asymptomatic carriers. We finally showed that AZT/IFN treatment reduced both HTLV-I proviral load and importantly VEGF plasma levels, suggesting a potential antiangiogenic effect of this therapy. These results provide further evidence for the efficacy and the mechanism of action of AZT/IFN therapy for ATLL in a developing country.\n",
      "Adult cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL) is a type of lymphoma consisting of T-cells that are related to infection with the human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1). Four clinical forms have been described (leukemic, lymphomatous, chronic, smoldering) and the phenotype corresponds to regulatory CD4+ T cells. The histological characteristics are variable, with neoplastic cells showing a size ranging from small to large and atypical nuclei with irregular contours. A series of genetic and molecular alterations have been described, which partially explain the lymphomagenesis of the neoplasm, some of which are also factors related to the clinical course and overall survival. ATLL is a neoplasm with a poor prognosis, but in recent years new targeted therapies have been designed, with encouraging responses. This neoplasm should continue to be studied to improve treatment and evolution.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

We also discuss the development of prognostic indicators for T-LBL, especially oncogenetic factors, that can identify patients at higher risk of relapse and may help further extend T-LBL patient survival. Pediatric-inspired acute lymphoblastic leukemia regimens have the potential to become the treatment of choice for adult T-LBL, and they might also reduce the need for other longstanding T-LBL interventions, particularly mediastinal irradiation and stem cell transplantation.Copyright Â© 2017 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.

      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in Japan presents at a median age of 70 years and only 5% of patients are <50 years of age. We conducted RNA and targeted DNA sequencing of 8 ATLLs from Japanese patients <50 years of age and identified 3 (37.5%) with both CTLA4-CD28 and inducible costimulator (ICOS)-CD28 fusions. Mutations of PLCG1, PRKCB, and STAT3, which were frequent in other ATLL-sequencing studies, were not identified. Differential expression analysis identified the negative checkpoint molecule LAG3 as the most downregulated gene among cases with the fusions. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated expression of CD80 and CD86, the ligands for CTLA4 and CD28, on ATLL cells and tumor-associated macrophages, respectively. Expression of CTLA4-CD28 in Ba/F3 cells conferred cytokine-independent growth when cocultured with Raji cells that express CD80 and CD86. Growth was associated with recruitment of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to CTLA4-CD28 and phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. A CTLA4-blocking antibody reduced cytokine-independent growth in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these results suggest that young Japanese ATLL cases have a unique biology dependent on cell-nonautonomous interactions that drive CD28 signaling. Assessment for CD28 fusions and treatment with CTLA4 blockade should be considered in younger patients with relapsed/refractory ATLL.Â© 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) has aggressive clinical behaviors, and improving its prognosis is a great challenge. A disease progression model from asymptomatic human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 carrier to aggressive-type ATLL has been proposed, and indolent ATLL comprising a smoldering or favorable chronic type is located at the midpoint. Even the most favorable smoldering type has a 4-year overall survival rate of <60%. Although watchful waiting is pervasive in patients with indolent ATLL, early therapeutic intervention is discussed among hematologists. Indolent ATLL was once termed T-cell-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Unlike indolent ATLL, several molecular-targeted agents at the initial treatment have dramatically improved CLL prognosis. Recent studies on CLL have revealed a similar progression model involving premalignant monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). In particular, individuals with high-count MBL have an increased lymphoma risk. Considering the unsatisfactory long-term prognosis of indolent ATLL, further treatment strategies, including precision medicine, are warranted.Copyright Â© 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n",
      "Recent advances in treatment for adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) are reviewed herein. It is currently possible to select a therapeutic strategy for ATL and predict prognosis by classification of patients by clinical subtypes and clinicopathological factors. Although the overall survival (OS) of patients with ATL has increased marginally because of advances in chemotherapy, further prolongation of survival might be difficult with conventional chemotherapy alone. Promising results have been reported for antiviral therapy using zidovudine and interferon-Î±, and, indeed, antiviral therapy is currently the standard treatment for patients with ATL in western countries. Remarkably, the 5-year OS rates are 100% for both the smoldering-type and chronic-type ATL. Recently, treatments for ATL have included allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and molecular targeted therapies. Furthermore, the anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody mogamulizumab has been shown to have marked cytotoxic effects on ATL cells, especially in the leukemic type of ATL. In the lymphoma type of ATL, the response rate may be improved by combining mogamulizumab with chemotherapy. It should be recognized that prevention of infection from carriers of human T-cell leukemia virus type-I and transfer of the virus from mother to infant are crucial issues for the eradication of ATL.Â© 2015 The Authors.

      "Globally, 5Â million to 10Â million people are infected with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, which causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in 2% to 5% of the carriers. ATLL is a rare but extremely aggressive malignancy that can be challenging to diagnose. Very little data exist on the incidence patterns of ATLL in the United States.ATLL cases reported to the National Program of Cancer Registries, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, and the New York State Cancer Registry were used for the study. Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated by age, race/ethnicity, sex, and year of diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate was compared among race/ethnicity groups with the SEER data.During 2001-2015, 2148 ATLL cases were diagnosed in the United States, 18% of which were in New York State. New York State had the highest incidence rate for ATLL, with a rising trend especially among non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs), whereas the incidence was stable across the remainder of the United States. NHBs were diagnosed at a younger median age (54Â years) and had a shorter overall survival (6Â months). In New York City, only 22.6% of the ATLL cases diagnosed were born in North America.This is the largest epidemiological study of ATLL in the United States and shows a rising incidence in New York City. NHBs have a younger age at presentation and poor overall survival. The rising incidence is largely due to NHBs originating from the Caribbean.Â© 2019 American Cancer Society.\n",
      "The adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) syndromes comprise neoplasms that arise in peripheral lymphoid tissues but a high frequency present with blood involvement mimicking T-cell leukemia. Clinically ATLL is sub-classified into four groups: acute, lymphomatous, chronic and smoldering. ATLL is etiologically linked to the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). The diagnosis of ATLL is based upon a combination of characteristic clinical manifestations, morphological and immunophenotypic changes of the malignant cells, in addition to the confirmation of HTLV-I infection. ATLL is an aggressive malignancy with a median survival of less than 12 months and no successful treatment yet available. Patients are either refractory or only transiently respond to chemotherapy or purine analogues. Smoldering and chronic ATLL pursue an indolent course and survival for years until the disease progresses and becomes refractory to therapy. The major causes of death in ATLL are opportunistic pulmonary infections and progressive disease, often in association with hypercalcemia.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a peripheral T-cell malignancy caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type I. The clinical course of ATL is heterogeneous, and this condition has different types, which are as follows: acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering. The chronic type is further subclassified into favorable and unfavorable subtypes. Acute, lymphoma, and unfavorable chronic type ATL and favorable chronic and smoldering-type ATL are defined as aggressive and indolent ATL, respectively. Newly identified prognostic indices based on clinical parameters and/or genetic predictors should be incorporated in the stratified treatment approach. The standard of care for aggressive ATL is multiagent chemotherapy, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation if applicable. Meanwhile, that for indolent ATL is watchful waiting until progression to the aggressive type. The combination of interferon-Î± and zidovudine is a treatment option for indolent ATL in other countries, and a confirmatory phase 3 trial is ongoing in Japan. In addition to mogamulizumab, lenalidomide, and brentuximab vedotin, which have been recently utilized in clinical practice, the use of a novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor has been filed for approval. Moreover, an EZH1/2 inhibitor has completed the enrollment of a phase 2 trial in Japan. The standard of care for elderly patients should be established because the median age of those with newly diagnosed ATL reaches up to 70 years old.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is an aggressive chemo-resistant malignancy secondary to HTLV-1 retrovirus. Prognosis of ATL remains dismal. Herein, we emphasized on the current ATL treatment modalities and their drawbacks, and opened up on promising targeted therapies with special focus on the HTLV-1 regulatory proteins Tax and HBZ.Indolent ATL and a fraction of acute ATL exhibit long-term survival following antiviral treatment with zidovudine and interferon-alpha. Monoclonal antibodies such as mogamulizumab improved response rates, but with little effect on survival. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation results in long-term survival in one third of transplanted patients, alas only few patients are transplanted. Salvage therapy with lenalidomide in relapsed/refractory patients leads to prolonged survival in some of them. ATL remains an unmet medical need. Targeted therapies focusing on the HTLV-1 viral replication and/or viral regulatory proteins, as well as on the host antiviral immunity, represent a promising approach for the treatment of ATL.Â© 2021.

      "Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive variant of peripheral T-cell lymphoma of CD4+Â T-malignant cells caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type-1. Despite aggressive treatment with multidrug combination chemotherapies, ATL confers a poor prognosis and commonly develops resistance to conventional treatments. Areas covered: Mogamulizumab is a humanized, defucosylated monoclonal antibody that acts by targeting the CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) on malignant cells of ATL. In phase I and II clinical trials, it has achieved overall response rates of 31-50% in CCR4+ malignancies. The most commonly observed hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events included lymphocytopenia, neutropenia, leukocytopenia, infusion reaction, rash, and pyrexia. Expert commentary: Mogamulizumab has shown significant efficacy in treating ATL with moderately high response rates and has been approved in Japan for use in ATL. It may serve as a bridge therapy to achieve disease control prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It also offers potential for use in combination with conventional chemotherapy. Determining the optimal combination of mogamulizumab with conventional and novel therapies remains an important strategy to improve the prognosis of patients with ATL.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a rare T-cell disorder that is etiologically linked to chronic infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1. ATLL is divided into four subtypes: acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering. The acute and lymphomatous variants are often described clinically as the aggressive types of ATLL. Treatment strategies traditionally have focused on antiviral therapy with zidovudine and interferon-alpha and combination chemotherapy. Novel therapeutic approaches include the use of monoclonal antibodies, anti-CCR4 therapy, immunomodulatory therapy, and anti-TAX vaccines. Future research must focus on multi-institutional clinical trial participation because of the rarity of this deadly hematologic malignancy.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",
      "Immunotherapy through immune checkpoints blockade and its subsequent clinical application has revolutionized the treatment of a spectrum of solid tumors. Blockade of Programmed cell death protein-1 and its ligand has shown promising results in clinical studies. The clinical trials that enrolled patients with different hematopoietic malignancies including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) showed that anti-PD-1 agents could have potential therapeutic effects in the patients. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a non-Hodgkin T-cell Lymphoma that is developed in a minority of HTLV-1-infected individuals after a long latency period. The inhibition of PD-1 as a treatment option is currently being investigated in ATLL patients. In this review, we present a summary of the biology of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, the evidence in the literature to support anti-PD-1/PDL-1 application in the treatment of different lymphoid, myeloid, and virus-related hematological malignancies, and controversies related to PD-1/PD-L1 blocking in the management of ATLL patients.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive disease caused by infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Successful treatment is limited by resistance to chemotherapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel effective strategies. Artesunate (ART), a widely used antimalarial compound, has been shown to exert cytotoxicity. Here, we aimed to assess the anti-ATLL activities of ART and to elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms involved in this effect. Compared with uninfected T cells, HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines were sensitive to ART-induced cytotoxicity. ART caused cell cycle arrest at G1 and/or G2/M phases, which was associated with decreased expression of cyclin dependent kinase 1/2/4/6, cyclin B1/D2/E and c-Myc, and increased expression of p21. ART-induced apoptosis corresponded to activation of caspase-8/9/3; decreased expression of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, myeloid cell leukemia-1, survivin, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1/2; and increased expression of Bak. ART increased intracellular reactive oxygen species and activation of the DNA damage marker Î³-H2AX. Moreover, ART-induced cytotoxicity was partly reversed by treatment with a reactive oxygen species scavenger, iron chelator, and necroptosis or ferroptosis inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of caspase-dependent and -independent lethal pathways. These effects were correlated with inhibition of nuclear factor-ÎºB and activator protein-1 signaling through dephosphorylation of IÎºBÎ±, IÎºB kinase (IKK) Î± and IKKÎ², and decreased expression of JunB and JunD. Importantly, intraperitoneal injection with ART lowered tumor burden in an ATLL murine model. These preclinical results provide a rationale for evaluating the efficacy of ART in patients with ATLL.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a mature T-cell neoplasm of post-thymic lymphocytes aetiologically linked to the human T-cell lymphotropic virus, HTLV-I, and with a distinct geographical distribution. The disease manifests with leukaemia in greater than two thirds of patients, while the remaining patients have a lymphomatous form. According to the disease manifestations, various forms which differ in clinical course and prognosis have been recognised: acute, chronic, smouldering and lymphoma. Organomegaly, skin involvement, circulating atypical lymphocytes (\"flower\" cells) with a CD4+ CD25+ phenotype and hypercalcaemia are the most common disease features. The diagnosis should be based on a constellation of clinical features and laboratory investigations. The latter comprise: lymphocyte morphology, immunophenotype, histology of the tissues affected in the pure lymphoma forms and serology or DNA analysis for HTLV-I. The differential diagnosis of ATLL includes other mature T-cell neoplasms such as T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), SÃ©zary syndrome (SS), peripheral T-cell lymphomas and occasionally healthy carriers of the virus or Hodgkin disease. The clinical course is aggressive with a median survival of less than 12 months in the acute and lymphoma forms. Despite major advances in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease, management of these patients remains a challenge for clinicians as they do not respond or achieve only transient responses to therapies used in high-grade lymphomas. The use of antiretroviral agents such as zidovudine in combination with interferon-alpha, with or without concomitant chemotherapy, has shown activity in this disease with improvement in survival and response rate. Consolidation with high dose therapy and autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation should be considered in young patients.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a poor prognosis malignancy of peripheral T-cells caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The low survival rates observed in the patients are the result of the lack of sufficient knowledge about the disease pathogenesis.In the present study, we first identified differentially expressed genes in ATLL patients and the cellular signaling pathways affected by them. Then, genes of these pathways were subjected to more comprehensive evaluations, including WGCNA and module validation studies on five external datasets. Finally, potential biomarkers were selected for qRT-PCR validation.Thirteen signaling pathways, including Apoptosis, Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection, IL-17 signaling pathway, pathways in cancer, T cell receptor signaling pathway, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, and seven others were selected for deeper investigations. Results of our in-depth bioinformatics evaluations, highlighted pathways related to regulation of immune responses, T-cell receptor and activation, regulation of cell signaling receptors and messengers, Wnt signaling pathway, and apoptosis as key players in ATLL pathogenesis. MAPK3, PIK3CD, KRAS, NFKB1, TNF, PLCB3, PLCB2, PLCB1, MAPK11, JUN, ITPR1, ADCY1, GNAQ, ADCY3, ADCY4, CHEK1, CCND1, SOS2, BAX, FOS and GNA12 were identified as possible biomarkers. Upregulation of ADCY1 and ADCY3 genes was confirmed via qRT-PCR.In this study, we performed a deep bioinformatic examination on a limited set of genes with high probabilities of involvement in the pathogenesis of ATLL. Our results highlighted signaling pathways and genes with potential key roles in disease formation and resistance against current treatment strategies. Further studies are required to test the possible benefits of highlighted genes as biomarkers and targets of treatment.Copyright Â© 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.\n",
      "Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was the first human retrovirus to be identified in the early 1980s. The isolation and identification of a related virus, HTLV-2, and the distantly related human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) immediately followed. Of the three retroviruses, two are associated definitively with specific diseases, HIV, with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HTLV-1, with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). While an estimated 10-20 million people worldwide are infected with HTLV-I, infection is endemic in the Caribbean, parts of Africa, southwestern Japan, and Italy. Approximately 4% of HTLV-I infected individuals develop ATLL, a disease with a poor prognosis. The clinical manifestations of infection and the current biology of HTLV viruses with emphasis on HTLV-1 are discussed in detail. The implications for improvements in diagnosis, treatment, intervention, and vaccination are included, as well as a discussion of the emergence of HTLV-1 and -2 as copathogens among HIV-1-infected individuals.2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive peripheral T-cell lymphoma with a dismal prognosis. Its most effective treatment is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), which provides a chance of long-term remission through a graft-versus-ATLL (GvATLL) effect. However, the incidence of relapse after allo-HSCT remains high at approximately 40%, and treatment options for patients with ATLL who have relapsed disease after allo-HSCT are limited. Accumulating evidence shows that mogamulizumab or lenalidomide use for relapsed disease even after allo-HSCT might have advantages with effects similar to that of GvATLL. Recent genomic and transcriptomic studies have shown that ATLL cells evade immune surveillance. Further investigations of incorporating immune-based approaches with new molecular target drugs as therapeutic options of patients with ATLL after transplantation are warranted.\n",
      "HTLV-1 is a virus that is endemic in southwesternJapan and the Caribbean and has been implicatedin the development of ATLL.

The literature suggeststhat a diagnosis of ATLL should be considered amongpatients of Caribbean origin or other endemicareas with skin lesions that suggest a cutaneousT-cell lymphoma, with clinicopathologic features ofmycosis fungoides. Differentiation between ATLLand cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is imperative as theyhave different prognoses and treatment approaches.\n",
      "Patients with recurrent adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) have a dismal prognosis. We retrospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide (LEN)Â in 11 consecutive patients with recurrent ATL after allo-HCT. The median time from allo-HCT to ATL recurrence was 111Â days (range, 20-1476), and that from allo-HCT to the initiation of LEN was 162Â days (range, 43-1560). The median initial daily dose of LEN was 10Â mg (range, 5-25), and the median duration of LEN treatment was 37Â days (range, 3-1078). Three patients (27%) achieved complete response and two (18%) achieved partial response (PR). The rates of complete or PR according to the involved site were 57% for skin and 50% for nodal or extranodal lesions. With a median follow-up of 1033Â days (range, 601-1465) among survivors, the 1-year probability of overall survival (OS) after ATL recurrence was 55%. Grade â¥3 toxicities included cytopenia (nÂ =Â 4), superficial vein thrombosis (nÂ =Â 1), and deep vein thrombosis (nÂ =Â 1). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) newly developed in five patients (45%) and worsened in four patients (36%). The median duration from the initiation of LEN to GVHD onset or worsening was 5Â days (range, 1-9). GVHD was manageable in all patients. Seven patients received mogamulizumab (MOG) for recurrent ATL before LEN treatment. The overall response rates to LEN were 57% in patients who had previously received MOG and 25% in those who had not. The 1-year probabilities of OS after recurrent ATL were 71% in patients who had previously received MOG and 25% in those who had not. Although cytopenia and GVHD are common among patients with recurrent ATL after allo-HCT, LEN may improve survival. Administering MOG before LEN may augment treatment efficacy in the allo-HCT population.Â© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n",

      "Allogeneic bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell transplantations are curative treatment modalities for adult TÂ cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) because of the intrinsic graft-versus-ATLL effect. However, limited information is available regarding whether cord blood transplantation (CBT) induces a curative graft-versus-ATLL effect against aggressive ATLL. To evaluate the effect of CBT against ATLL, we retrospectively analyzed data from 175 patients with ATLL who initially underwent single-unit CBT. The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate was 20.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.8% to 27.4%). A multivariate analysis revealed that the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was a favorable prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio, .10; 95% CI, .01 to .94; PÂ =Â .044). Furthermore, the 2-year OS (42.7%; 95% CI, 28.1% to 56.6%) of patients with grade 1 to 2 acute GVHD was higher than that of patients without acute GVHD (24.2%; 95% CI, 11.2% to 39.8%; PÂ =Â .048). However, the cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) was high (46.1%; 95% CI, 38.2% to 53.7%), and early death was particularly problematic. In conclusion, CBT cures patients with ATLL partly through a graft-versus-ATLL effect. However, novel interventions will be required, particularly in the early phase, to reduce TRM and optimize GVHD.Copyright Â© 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a malignancy of mature CD4+ T-cells caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Twenty million people are believed to be infected throughout the world, mostly in Japan, Africa, the Caribbean, and South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru. ATL affects about 5% of infected individuals and is classified in the following clinical forms: acute, lymphoma, primary cutaneous tumoral, chronic (favorable and unfavorable), and smoldering (leukemic and non-leukemic). Although it is considered an aggressive disease, there are cases with a long progression. We emphasize the importance of clinical classification as an indispensable element for evaluating prognosis and appropriate therapeutic approach. Since several cases have been published in Brazil and this disease is still poorly known, we decided to make a review paper for dissemination of clinical, hematological and pathological aspects, diagnosis, and therapy. The best way to reduce the occurrence of ATL would be halting the transmission of the virus through breastfeeding.\n",

      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a malignancy of peripheral T lymphocytes caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. Available therapies for ATLL have minimal efficacy, with few responders and poor survival. New therapies are needed for ATLL patients. Three decades of research in this field has resulted in accumulation of a wealth of knowledge about the molecular pathways underlying the proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T cells. Inappropriate over- and under-activation of various signaling pathways can contribute to pathological processes such as neoplasia. Molecular and pharmacological interventions that target the aberrant state of activation are thus of potential therapeutic benefit. Here we review how signal transduction pathway components including nuclear factor-kappaB, activator protein-1, janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt contribute to the pathogenesis of ATLL. The targeted inhibition of such molecules to suppress the growth of HTLV-1-infected T cells both in vitro and in vivo is also discussed. The potential translation of such strategies into effective therapies for patients with ATLL may improve the poor outcome associated with this neoplasia.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a malignancy of mature T cells associated with chronic infection by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1). ATLL patients with aggressive subtypes have dismal outcomes. We demonstrate that ATLL cells co-opt an early checkpoint within the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) pathway, resulting in survival advantage. This early checkpoint revolves around an interaction between the deubiquitinase CYLD and its target RIPK1. The status of RIPK1 K63-ubiquitination determines cell fate by creating either a prosurvival signal (ubiquitinated RIPK1) or a death signal (deubiquitinated RIPK1). In primary ATLL samples and in cell line models, an increased baseline level of CYLD phosphorylation was observed. We therefore tested the hypothesis that this modification of CYLD, which has been reported to inhibit its deubiquitinating function, leads to increased RIPK1 ubiquitination and thus provides a prosurvival signal to ATLL cells. CYLD phosphorylation can be pharmacologically reversed by IKK inhibitors, specifically by TBK1/IKKÎµ and IKKÎ² inhibitors (MRT67307 and TPCA). Both of the IKK sub-families can phosphorylate CYLD, and the combination of MRT67307 and TPCA have a marked effect in reducing CYLD phosphorylation and triggering cell death. ATLL cells overexpressing a kinase-inactive TBK1 (TBK1-K38A) demonstrate lower CYLD phosphorylation and subsequently reduced proliferation. IKK blockade reactivates CYLD, as evidenced by the reduction in RIPK1 ubiquitination, which leads to the association of RIPK1 with the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) to trigger cell death. In the absence of CYLD, RIPK1 ubiquitination remains elevated following IKK blockade and it does not associate with the DISC. SMAC mimetics can similarly disrupt CYLD phosphorylation and lead to ATLL cell death through reduction of RIPK1 ubiquitination, which is CYLD dependent. These results identify CYLD as a crucial regulator of ATLL survival and point to its role as a potential novel target for pharmacologic modification in this disease.\n",
      "A 66-year-old woman who was positive for human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) antibody developed mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) with interstitial pneumonia, and was successfully treated with corticosteroid. One year later, under maintenance treatment of prednisolone (PSL), she contracted acute type adult Tcell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) without flaring of MCTD. MCTD is considered to be as one of the HTL-V-I-related inflammatory diseases, however the development of ATLL during the treatment of HTL-V-I-related MCTD has not been well studied. Here, we review the literature and raise the issue of the mutual interactions between MCTD-causative anti-HTLV-I immune response and anti-ATLL immune response.\n",
      "Human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was the first oncogenic human retrovirus to be discovered, more than 25 years ago. HTLV-1 infects 15 to 20 million individuals worldwide. This oncoretrovirus can be transmitted in three ways: horizontally (sexually), vertically (mother to child), and via blood transfusion. HTLV-1 causes two major diseases: adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). ATLL can be classified into four major subtypes: a smoldering type, a chronic type, a lymphoma type, and a leukemic type. Because of intrinsic chemoresistance and severe immunosuppression, the survival rate of ATLL patients, especially those who develop the acute leukemic or lymphoma forms, is very poor, and such clonal malignant CD4 expansion remains one of the most severe lymphoproliferations. This article discusses a number of recent treatments including antiretroviral therapy, aggressive chemotherapy, and allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation, as well as new drugs.\n",
      "Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a powerful new tool in the treatment of cancer, with prolonged responses in multiple diseases, including hematologic malignancies, such as Hodgkin lymphoma. However, in a recent report, we demonstrated that the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab led to rapid progression in patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) (NCT02631746). We obtained primary cells from these patients to determine the cause of this hyperprogression. Analyses of clonality, somatic mutations, and gene expression in the malignant cells confirmed the report of rapid clonal expansion after PD-1 blockade in these patients, revealed a previously unappreciated origin of these malignant cells, identified a novel connection between ATLL cells and tumor-resident regulatory T cells (Tregs), and exposed a tumor-suppressive role for PD-1 in ATLL. Identifying the mechanisms driving this alarming outcome in nivolumab-treated ATLL may be broadly informative for the growing problem of rapid progression with immune checkpoint therapies.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is a peripheral T-cell malignancy, closely associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I infection. Clinically, ATL is classified into four subtypes: acute, lymphoma, chronic and smoldering type. Although the prognosis of chronic and smoldering-type ATL is relatively good, that of patients with acute- or lymphoma-type ATL still remains extremely poor. Zidovudine/IFN-Î± therapy seems to be promising, although its efficacy has not yet been confirmed in well-designed prospective studies. High-dose chemotherapy with the support of autologous transplantation does not improve outcome. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is promising and approximately 40% of aggressive ATL patients are expected to survive long-term, although transplantation-related mortality is as high as 40-50%. Stem cell transplantation using reduced-intensity conditioning is also effective and safer, with graft-versus-ATL and graft-versus-human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I effects observed after transplantation. Novel approaches including new agents such as purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors, or targeted immunotherapy using antichemokine receptor-4 antibody or dendritic cell/peptide vaccine are also warranted.\n",
      "CADM1/TSLC1 (Cell adhesion molecule 1/Tumor suppressor in lung cancer 1) is a cell adhesion molecule that was originally identified as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer. CADM1/TSLC1 expression is reduced in a variety of cancers via promoter methylation, and this reduction is associated with poor prognosis and enhanced metastatic potential. In contrast, we observed that CADM1/TSLC1 is highly and ectopically expressed in all primary adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cells and in most human T-cell leukemia virus type (HTLV)-1-infected T-cell and ATLL cell lines. No expression, however, was detected in CD4+ T cells or in several other non-HTLV-1-infected leukemia cells. Moreover, we identified that high CADM1/TSLC1 expression plays an important role in enhanced cell-cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium, tumor growth and the ability of ATLL cells to infiltrate organs. We developed various antibodies as diagnostic tools to identify CADM1+ ATLL cells. Using flow cytometry, we determined that CADM1/TSLC1 is present on the surface of ATLL cells. The percentage of CD4+CADM1+ cells in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1 carriers and ATLL patients was highly correlated with the DNA copy number of HTLV-1 in lymphocytes. In particular, we identified the soluble form of CADM1/TSLC1 in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1 carriers and ATLL patients. Therefore, measurements of soluble CADM1/TSLC1 serum levels and the detection of CD4+CADM1+ cells in the blood, when combined with standard diagnostic methods, would be useful for identifying and monitoring disease progression in HTLV-1 carriers. Such tests would provide increased accuracy and may aid in early diagnosis and in determining the effects of ATLL treatments.\n",
      "Acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a post thymic (peripheral) T-cell neoplasm caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Historically, the chemotherapy regimen CHOP (cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone) has been the standard treatment of this rare malignancy. However, its prognosis is poor and median survival in the aggressive variants of ATLL is only 6-10 months. Recently, a more aggressive regimen piloted in Japan, vincristine/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/prednisone (VCAP)- doxorubicin/ranimustine/prednisone (AMP)- vindesine/etoposide/carboplatin/prednisone (VECP), has been reported to yield better survival results over biweekly CHOP in a phase III trial. However, the hyper- cyclophosphamide/vincristine/doxorubicin/dexamethasone (CVAD) regimen is a much more frequently used regimen for the treatment of aggressive hematologic malignancies, and has a higher intensity then CHOP. Yet, there is little reported experience with hyper-CVAD regimen in ATLL.We present 2 patients diagnosed with ATLL who were treated with hyper-CVAD chemotherapy and have achieved a durable complete remission. One of the patients has gone on to receive an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and has been in complete remission for over 18 months. The other has been in a continuous remission for approximately 12 months. We also review the past published experience with the hyper-CVAD regimen in patients with ATLL.A commonly used chemotherapy regimen for aggressive hematologic malignancies, hyper-CVAD, can induce durable remissions in patients with ATLL.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an exceedingly refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Despite the approval of a few new drugs for managing patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory ATL in recent years, the prognosis has yet to be substantially ameliorated. This study focuses on recent topics on the development of innovative therapies and the identification of prognostic indicators, considering the recent elucidation of the pathogenesisof ATL. Specifically, this study also delineates the advancements in developing novel EZH1/2 inhibitors and comprehensive genetic analysis; the molecular pathogenesis determined through comprehensive gene knockdown and knockout techniques, with its potential as a therapeutic target; the latest discoveries from the analysis of super-enhancer regions; and the prognostic factors extracted from comprehensive genetic analysis.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a mature T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder associated with the human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) infection. ATLL predominantly affects individuals within HTLV-1 endemic areas such as Japan, areas of Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. HTLV-1 preferentially infects CD4+ T-cells, and several genetic hits must occur before ATLL develops. ATLL is classically divided into four clinical variants based on manifestations of disease: acute, chronic, lymphomatous, and smouldering. As of 2019, a new subtype has been described: lymphoma type of ATL, extranodal primary cutaneous. In this review, emphasis will be taken to describe the common clinicopathologic manifestations of the disease, advances in biomarker discovery, mutational landscape and targeted therapeutic approaches to treat this highly aggressive and frequently lethal type of T-cell lymphoma.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) develops in elderly individuals who have been infected with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and the prognosis for patients with ATLL has been extremely poor. Retrospective studies of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) for selected populations of patients have achieved several encouraging results; however, the reported incidence of transplantation-related mortality (TRM) have been high, even though more than 80% of patients received stem cells from related donors and the patients were relatively young for ATLL. This report documents a prospective feasibility study of alloSCT with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIST) for elderly ATLL patients (>50 years). Regimen-related toxicities and nonhematologic toxicities were acceptable. Fourteen of 15 evaluable patients achieved complete donor chimerism within 90 days, and 1 patient had early TRM after RIST. The HTLV-1 proviral load became undetectable in 8 of 15 patients, suggesting that RIST has potential as an antiviral treatment. The results of alloSCT are promising, and 30% to 40% of patients who achieve remission and have suitable donors can now become long-term survivors with either conventional alloSCT or RIST. It is clear that a graft-versus-ATLL effect is present after alloSCT, regardless of the conditioning regimen or the stem cell source.\n",
      "Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) induced by human T cell leukemia virus I is resistant to conventional therapy. Six patients with ATLL were treated with a new antitumor agent, MST-16, which is a derivative of bis(2,6-dioxopiperazine). Two patients achieved complete remission, lasting 12 months and more than 8 months, and 2 others partial remission, lasting 2 months and 6 weeks, respectively. The major toxicity was myelosuppression. Other toxicities were not severe and were well tolerable. Orally administered MST-16 is a promising agent for the treatment of ATLL.\n",
      "Adult T cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL) is a CD4+ lymphoproliferative malignancy resulting from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. It includes differing clinical forms classified as smoldering, chronic, lymphomatous, and acute ATLL. The Tax protein of HTLV-1 has been implicated as a viral oncoprotein which enhances virus replication and alters cellular gene expression, including activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF kB), to result in lymphoid transformation. Chemotherapy for ATLL has had limited efficacy with median survivals of about 1 yr. Antiviral therapy employing zidovudine and interferon has shown promising results, as have antibody-based therapies to the interleukin 2 (IL2) receptor. Novel approaches employ a combination of chemo/antiretroviral therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or inhibitors of NF kB activation.\n",
      "ATL is a rare and highly aggressive T cell malignancy caused by HTLV-1. We will review the state of the art of ATL epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment.Because of population migration, cases of ATL in non-HTLV-1 endemic countries including North America and Europe are increasingly recognized. ATL has diverse clinical manifestations, limited treatment options not widely available globally, and poor prognosis despite therapy. A small subset of patients may achieve prolonged survival with antiviral therapy or allogeneic stem cell transplant. Mogamulizumab, an anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody, and lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug, are approved for ATL in Japan. Molecular studies have identified key alterations in T cell signaling and DNA methylation that may further guide drug development. Patients should be encouraged to enroll in prospective clinical trials when possible. Ongoing, collaborative, international research continues to elucidate disease pathogenesis and contribute to an evolving therapeutic landscape for ATL.\n",
      "Genomic analysis of cancer offers the hope of identifying new treatments or aiding in the selection of existing treatments. Rare leukemias pose additional challenges in this regard as samples may be hard to acquire and when found the underlying pathway may not be attractive to drug development since so few individuals are affected. In this case, it can be useful to identify common mutational overlap among subsets of rare leukemias to increase the number of individuals that may benefit from a targeted therapy. This chapter examines the current mutational landscape of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia with a focus on STAT3 mutations, the most common mutation in LGL leukemia to date. We examined the linkage between these mutations and autoimmune symptoms and disorders, in cases of obvious and suspected LGL leukemia. We then summarized and compared mutations in a set of other rare leukemias that also have JAK/STAT signaling pathway activation brought about by genomic changes. These include T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), select peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Though STAT3 activation is common in these leukemias, the way in which it is achieved, such as the activating cytokine pathway and/or the co-mutational background, is quite diverse.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a mature T-cell neoplasm with extremely poor prognosis caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The distribution of HTLV-1 and the incidence of ATLL in endemic areas have been well described, however, little is known about the incidences and the trends of the disease in nonendemic areas. Recently, studies have shown that the HTLV-1 carriers are increasing in nonendemic areas. Also, the incidence of ATLL seems to be significantly increasing in nonendemic areas suggesting that HTLV-1 carriers have emigrated from endemic areas. These epidemiologic studies indicate the necessity of edification of the disease caused by HTLV-1 and establishing appropriate preventive methods against infection in nonendemic areas.\n",
      "Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is one of the peripheral T cell malignant neoplasms strongly associated with human T cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I). Although the viral transactivating protein Tax has been proposed to play a critical role in leukemogeneis as shown by its transforming activity in various experimental systems, additional cellular events are required for the development of ATLL. One of the genetic events in ATLL is inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Among many candidates for tumor suppressor genes, the main genetic events have been reported to center around the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors ((CDKIs) p15INK4A, p16INK4B, p18INK4C, p19INK4D, p21WAF1, p27KIP1, and p57KIP2), p53 and Rb genes; all of them play a major regulatory role during G1 to S transition in the cell cycle. Acute/lymphomatous ATLL has frequent alterations of p15 (20%) and p16 (28-67%), while chronic/smoldering ATLL has fewer abnormalities of p15 (0-13%) and p16 (5-26%). Most of these changes are deletion of the genes; fewer samples have mutations. ATLL patients with deleted p15 and/or p16 genes have significantly shorter survival than those individuals with both genes preserved. Although genetic alterations of p18, p19, p21, p27 have rarely been reported, inactivation of these genes may contribute to the development of ATLL because low expression levels of these genes seem to mark ATLL. The p53 gene is mutated in 10-50% of acute/lymphomatous ATLL. Functional impairment of the p53 protein, even if the gene has wild-type sequences, has been suggested in HTLV-I infected cells. Each of these genetic events are mainly found in acute/lymphomatous ATLL, suggesting that alterations of these genes may be associated with transformation to an aggressive phenotype. The Rb tumor suppressor gene is infrequently structurally altered, but one half of ATLL cases have lost expression of this key protein. Notably, alterations of one of the CDKIs, p53 and Rb genes appear to obviate the need for inactivation of other genes in the same pathway. A novel tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 6q may also have a critical role in the pathogenesis of ATLL. Taken together, tumor suppressor genes are frequently altered in acute/lymphomatous ATLL and their alteration is probably the driving force fueling the transition from chronic/smoldering to acute/lymphomatous ATLL.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a HTLV-1 induced T-cell malignancy with an extremely poor prognosis. There is a long latency period between HTLV-1 infection and the onset of ATL, which indicates the existence of multistep mechanisms of leukemogenesis in the infected cells. Tax, which is encoded by the HTLV-1 pX region, plays a crucial role in HTLV-1 leukemogenesis and is a major target of CTL. We developed an anti-ATL therapeutic vaccine consisting of autologous dendritic cells that is pulsed with Tax peptides (Tax-DC). The vaccination protocol was completed with three injections at a 2-week interval, within one month. Good quality of life and long-term treatment-free survival were observed for more than 3 years in two of the three patients enrolled in the pilot study. Furthermore, the proviral load remained mostly around the carrier level, with minor fluctuation, after vaccination. Tax-specific proliferative CTL responses were observed in all cases and sporadically augmented responses were also subsequently detected. The Tax-DC vaccine might be a well-tolerated and long-lasting maintenance therapy that is acceptable even for elderly patients. Based on the encouraging results, we are now conducting a clinical trial of Tax-DC vaccine combined with anti-CCR4 antibody to enhance the efficacy of the vaccine as next-generation immunotherapy.\n",
      "In summary, we present this as the first reported case of both isosporiasis and strongyloidiasis complicating HTLV-I-associated ATLL. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of these parasites in the immunocompromised host are necessary to prevent severe wasting and dehydration. This should also prevent the significant morbidity and mortality associated with dissemination well-described for Strongyloides, and recently seen at autopsy in a patient with isosporiasis. Recurrent infections are common with both organisms, therefore chronic suppressive therapy and prophylactic treatment prior to chemotherapy or steroid administration is warranted.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is a distinct peripheral T-lymphocytic malignancy associated with a retrovirus designated human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1). The diversity in clinical features and prognosis of patients with this disease has led to its subclassification into the following four categories: acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The chronic and smoldering subtypes are considered indolent and are usually managed with watchful waiting until disease progression, analogous to the management of some patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or other indolent histology lymphomas. Patients with aggressive ATL generally have a poor prognosis because of multidrug resistance of malignant cells, a large tumor burden with multiorgan failure, hypercalcemia, and/or frequent infectious complications as a result of a profound T-cell immunodeficiency. Under the sponsorship of the 13th International Conference on Human Retrovirology: HTLV, a group of ATL researchers joined to form a consensus statement based on established data to define prognostic factors, clinical subclassifications, and treatment strategies. A set of response criteria specific for ATL reflecting a combination of those for lymphoma and CLL was proposed. Clinical subclassification is useful but is limited because of the diverse prognosis among each subtype. Molecular abnormalities within the host genome, such as tumor suppressor genes, may account for these diversities. A treatment strategy based on the clinical subclassification and prognostic factors is suggested, including watchful waiting approach, chemotherapy, antiviral therapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (alloHSCT), and targeted therapies.\n",
      "Human T-cell lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I)-related adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a model disease for proof of viral oncogenesis. HTLV-I infection is endemic in southern Japan and the Caribbean basin, and occurs sporadically in Africa, Central and South America, the Middle East, and the southeastern United States. ATL occurs in only 2% to 4% of HTLV-I-infected people [1-3]. When it does occur, it is usually aggressive and difficult to treat; most people survive for less than 1 year [1-3]. Combination chemotherapy with cytotoxic agents has yielded complete response rates of 20% to 45%, but responses usually last only a few months [3]. Recently, novel treatments, such as monoclonal antibodies directed at the interleukin-2 receptor and the combination of interferon alfa and zidovudine, have been shown to be active in the treatment of patients with ATL. A small percentage of patients achieve long-lasting remissions [2,3].\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma(ATLL)can infiltrate throughout various organs and frequently involves the gastrointestinal tract. However, bowel perforation in ATLL patients is rare. Herein, we present a case of ATLL with bowel perforation. A 75-year-old man presented with bowel distension. Computed tomography showed a large mass of the cecum. Edema and stenosis of the ascending colon was seen on colonoscopy, and tumor on the anal side of the stenosis was also found. After admission, the patient complained of abdominal pain with a peritoneal irritation sign. Free air was seen around a large mass of the cecum on computed tomography and an emergency operation was performed under the diagnosis of bowel perforation. Microscopic examination revealed bowel infiltration of ATLL. Gastrointestinal perforation can be caused by ATLL itself and is associated with a poor prognosis. The standard treatment for ATLL is chemotherapy but emergency surgery is necessary in case of perforation. It is important to observe the patient with ATLL carefully.\n",
      "Adult T cell leukaemia-lymphoma (ATL) was first discovered and reported in Japan, where it has a high incidence in the south-west region. The first human retrovirus HTLV-I (human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I) is considered to be related to its aetiology. In ATL endemic areas, HTLV-I carriers form a fairly high percentage of the population, even among healthy individuals. ATL shows diverse clinical features. It can be divided into four subtypes: acute, chronic, smouldering and lymphoma type. ATL cells originate from the CD4-positive subset of peripheral T cells; they show a characteristic notch in the nucleus and a tendency to lobulation. ATL resists chemotherapy, and patients with acute and lymphoma types have a fairly poor prognosis. A definite diagnosis of ATL is made by documenting the presence of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the DNA of tumour cells. HTLV-I infection is caused by transmission of live lymphocytes via three routes (from mother to child, from males to females, and by transfusion). Familial occurrence of ATL is frequently seen. HTLV-I infection is seen in other countries, but its incidence is highest in Japan. Infection with HTLV-I is a direct cause of ATL. Furthermore, infection with this virus can indirectly cause many other diseases via the induction of immunodeficiency, such as chronic lung disease, opportunistic lung infection, cancer of other organs, monoclonal gammopathy, chronic renal failure, strongyloidiasis, non-specific dermatomycosis, HTLV-I-associated lymphadenitis, HTLV-I uveitis and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy-tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is caused by human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Patients with ATLL frequently develop humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) resulting from increased osteoclastic bone resorption. Our goal was to investigate the mechanisms of ATLL-induced osteoclastic bone resorption. Murine calvaria co-cultured with HTLV-1-infected cells directly or conditioned media from cell cultures had increased osteoclast activity that was dependent on RANKL, indicating that factors secreted from ATLL cells had a stimulatory effect on bone resorption. Factors released from resorbing bone stimulated proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), both osteoclast stimulators, were expressed in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Interestingly, when HTLV-1-infected T-cells were co-cultured with pre-osteoblasts, the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG), an osteoclast inhibitory factor, was significantly down-regulated in the pre-osteoblasts. When OPG was added into the ex vivo osteoclastogenesis assay induced by HTLV-1-infected T-cells, osteoclastogenesis was strongly inhibited. In addition, HTLV-1-infected T-cells inhibited expression of early osteoblast genes and induced late genes. These regulators will serve as future therapeutic targets for the treatments of HHM in ATLL.\n",
      "Human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1)+ Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is difficult to differentiate from adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) with HL-like histology (HL-like ATLL).Cytological and immunohistological features, HTLV-1 proviral DNA integration, and rearrangements of the T-cell receptor (TCR) CÎ²1 gene were examined in 11 HTLV-1+ patients with HL-like disease.Six patients were classified as HTLV-1+ HL and five as HL-like ATLL in accordance with genetic findings of HTLV-1 proviral DNA integration and rearrangements of the TCR CÎ²1 gene. Small ordinary looking lymphocytes with round nuclei were detected in the background of six patients with HTLV-1+ HL, which were immunohistochemically negative for CD25 and CC chemokine receptor (CCR)4 and had a low MIB1 labeling index (mean: 28.3%). In the HL-like ATLL specimens, small- and medium-sized atypical lymphocytes with indented and irregular-shaped nuclei were found, and were diffusely positive for CD25 and CCR4, with high MIB1 labeling (mean: 76%). Both groups had scattered CD30+ and CD15+ Hodgkin and Reed Sternberg (RS) giant cells, with or without CD20 expression and Epstein-Barr virus infection. The 50% overall survival period was significantly longer for the HTLV-1+ HL group (180Â months) than for the HL-like ATLL group (7.8Â months; PÂ =Â .004).HTLV-1+ HL showed typical small lymphoid cells with a low MIB1 labeling index in a background of Hodgkin and RS cells, with some scattered CD25+ and CCR4+ lymphocytes. In HTLV-1 endemic areas, distinguishing HTLV-1+ HL from HL-like ATLL is important because of their differing treatment strategies and prognoses.Â© 2020 The Authors.

      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a malignancy of mature T lymphocytes caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type I. Intensive combination chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been introduced since the previous Japanese nationwide survey was performed in the late 1980s. In this study, we delineated the current features and management of ATL in Japan. The clinical data were collected retrospectively from the medical records of patients diagnosed with ATL between 2000 and 2009, and a total of 1665 patients' records were submitted to the central office from 84 institutions in Japan. Seventy-one patients were excluded; 895, 355, 187, and 157 patients with acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types, respectively, remained. The median survival times were 8.3, 10.6, 31.5, and 55.0 months, and 4-year overall survival (OS) rates were 11%, 16%, 36%, and 52%, respectively, for acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The number of patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 227, and their median survival time and OS at 4 years after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 5.9 months and 26%, respectively. This study revealed that the prognoses of the patients with acute and lymphoma types were still unsatisfactory, despite the recent progress in treatment modalities, but an improvement of 4-year OS was observed in comparison with the previous survey. Of note, one-quarter of patients who could undergo transplantation experienced long survival. It is also noted that the prognosis of the smoldering type was worse than expected.Â© 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.\n",
      "The outcome of successful infection, including human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), is determined by the interactions between the host and the infectious agent. Ten years of work on HTLV-1-associated diseases in an endemic region of Iran have been critically compared in the present study. The outstanding findings of RNA-seq, system biology analysis, and gene expression measurements on adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and enzootic bovine leukosis(EBL) in our lab encouraged us to investigate the significant role of oncogenes in the ATLL malignancy. Most studies assessed such interactions by the proviral load (PVL), Tax, and HBZ regulatory proteins in HTLV-1 and the host's immunological and cell cycle factors. The current study is a comprehensive comparing view of our previously published and unpublished results investigating the HTLV-1-host interactions leading to the transformation of the infected cell. The main focus has been on the essential proteins implicated in the virus dissemination, cell survival, and proliferation of infected cells toward leukemia development and progression. Similar to its homolog BLV-AS-1-2 in EBL, the HTLV-1-HBZ is a pivotal factor in the maintenance and progression of the ATLL. In addition, the inappropriate activities of the PI3K/Akt pathway, BRCAs, and RAD51 in the DNA repair system, which are orchestrating many other immortalization pathways, might be the central factors in the manifestation of ATLL. HTLV-1-HBZ and the host PI3K/Akt pathway, BCAs, and RAD51 could be suggested as influential targets for the prognosis and proper therapy of ATLL.Copyright Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

      "Human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) in a small population of infected individuals after a long incubation period. Although the process of clonal evolution of ATL cells may involve multiple steps, ATL cells from half of the ATL cases still retain the ability to express HTLV-I Tax, a key molecule of HTLV-I leukemogenesis. A recent finding of reactivation of Tax-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in ATL patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation suggests the presence of Tax expression in vivo and potential contribution of the CTL to antitumor immunity. This is consistent with the results of a series of animal experiments indicating that Tax-specific CTL limit the growth of HTLV-I-infected cells in vivo, although the animal model mimics only an early phase of HTLV-I infection and leukemogenesis. Establishment of an insufficient HTLV-I-specific T-cell response and an increased viral load in orally HTLV-I-infected rats suggests that host HTLV-I-specific T-cell response at a primary HTLV-I infection can be a critical determinant of persistent HTLV-I levels thereafter. These findings indicate that Tax-targeted vaccines may be effective for prophylaxis of ATL in a high-risk group, and also for therapy of ATL in at least half the cases.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a peripheral T-cell lymphoma caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 infection. Although conjunctival lymphoma is commonly reported with B-cell lymphoma, it rarely occurs in cases of ATLL. A 73-year-old Japanese female patient was admitted to our institution with evidence of abnormal lymphocytes, lymphadenopathy, and lung nodular lesions. Acute type ATLL was diagnosed, and therapy following the mLSG15 protocol was initiated. At the end of the second course, new bone lesions were detected. A modified treatment regimen was scheduled, but was postponed due to the appearance of gastrointestinal symptoms. Close observation resulted in a diagnosis of cytomegalovirus enteritis. One month after the diagnosis, the patient developed pain and discomfort in her left eye, which was determined to be due to a bulbar conjunctival tumor. Pathological findings revealed conjunctival infiltration of ATLL. Mogamulizumab treatment was initiated and was successful in eradicating the conjunctival lesions after the first course. However, at the end of the third course of therapy, pancytopenia was noted. Therefore, mogamulizumab therapy was discontinued, and the patient was on follow-up observation. Although there was no relapse of the conjunctival lesions, the patient died 1 year after the initial diagnosis, following therapy resistance.\n",
      "We established an IL-2 and IL-4 (IL2/4) - dependent adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cell line (YG-PLL) by adding poly-L-lysine (PLL) to the culture medium. YG-PLL originates from lymphoma cells and contains a defective HTLV-I proviral genome. Although YG-PLL cannot survive without IL-2/4, the follicular dendritic cell (FDC)-like cell line HK expressing OX40-ligand gene (OX40L+HK) inhibited their death in the presence of soluble neutral polymers. After the prevention of cell death, YG-PLL proliferated on OX40L+HK without IL2/4 in the presence of two kinds of positively or negatively charged polymers. In particular, dermatan sulfate and poly-L-histidine supported growth for more than 4 months. Therefore, the original lymphoma cells proliferated transiently in the presence of IL2/4, and their growth arrest was inhibited by the addition of PLL. Furthermore, YG-PLL lost IL2/4 dependency by the following 3-step procedure: preculture with IL2/4 and neutral polymers, 3-day culture with neutral polymer on OX40L+HK to inhibit cell death, and co-culture with OX40L+HK in the presence of the positively and negatively charged polymers. The extracellular environment made by soluble polymers plays a role in the growth of ATLL in vitro.\n",
      "Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection can cause adult T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (ATLL), an incurable, chemotherapy-resistant malignancy. In a quest for new therapeutic targets, our study sought to determine the levels of AKT, mTOR, and PI3K in ATLL MT-2 cells, HTLV-1 infected NIH/3T3 cells (Inf-3T3), and HTLV-1 infected patients (Carrier, HAM/TSP, and ATLL). Furthermore, the effects of rigosertib, wortmannin, and rapamycin on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to inhibit the proliferation of ATLL cells were examined. The results showed that mRNA expression of Akt/PI3K/mTOR was down-regulated in carrier, HAM/TSP, and ATLL patients, as well as MT-2, and Inf-3T3 cells, compared to the healthy individuals and untreated MT-2 and Inf-3T3 as controls. However, western blotting revealed an increase in the phosphorylated and activated forms of AKT and mTOR. Treating the cells with rapamycin, wortmannin, and rigosertib decreased the phosphorylated forms of Akt and mTOR and restored their mRNA expression levels. Using these inhibitors also significantly boosted the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as well as the expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in the MT-2 and Inf-3T3cells. Rigosertib was more potent than wortmannin and rapamycin in inducing sub-G1 and G2-M cell cycle arrest, as well as late apoptosis in the Inf-3T3 and MT-2 cells. It also synergized the cytotoxic effects of vincristine. These findings demonstrate that HTLV-1 downregulation of the mRNA level may occur as a negative feedback response to increased PI3K-Akt-mTOR phosphorylation by HTLV-1. Therefore, using rigosertib alone or in combination with common chemotherapy drugs may be beneficial in ATLL patients.Â© 2023 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.\n",
      "Breast involvement of Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) is extremely rare, and the data on the characteristics are limited. We herein describe a 49-year-old woman who presented with skin involvement of ATLL. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed bilateral breast lesions. Although the patient once achieved a complete metabolic response, a relapse of her ATLL occurred. The patient received subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). To our knowledge, only four cases of ATLL with breast involvement have previously been reported, and the prognoses have generally been poor. Breast lesions of ATLL have aggressive features, and intensive systemic chemotherapy and HSCT are required to improve survival.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is a distinct malignancy of regulatory T cell (Treg)/TH2 cells caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1), with a high frequency of expression of CD3/CD4/CD25/CCR4 and FoxP3 in about half of the cells. However, in primary ATL cells, although expression of the virus, including the Tax oncoprotein, appears just after an in vitro culture, integration sites of the provirus into the host genome are random, and chromosomal/genetic abnormalities are complex. ATL is thus a single disease entity that is caused by HTLV-1 and possesses diverse molecular features. The clinical features and prognosis of ATL vary, and this has led to subtypes classified into four categories: acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering types, based on lactate dehydrogenase and calcium values and organ involvement. Approximately 15 to 20 million individuals are infected with HTLV-1 worldwide, 1.1 million of whom reside in Japan, and the annual incidence of ATL has been estimated to be approximately 1,000. HTLV-1 infection early in life, mainly from breast feeding, is crucial for the development of ATL. The age-specific occurrence of ATL and complex genome abnormalities that accumulate with disease progression suggest a multistep carcinogenesis model following HTLV-1 infection. Various treatment options are available for ATL and consist of watchful waiting for indolent ATL, intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for aggressive ATL, and a combination of IFNÎ± and zidovudine for ATL with leukemic manifestation. Several promising new agents, including an anti-CCR4 antibody, are currently undergoing clinical trials associated with translational research.

      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a peripheral T-cell malignancy caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1), and its prognosis remains poor. Three to five percent of HTLV-1 carriers, infected mainly by breast feeding, develop ATL after a latency period as long as 70 years. The standard of care for aggressive ATL and indolent ATL comprises intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, if applicable, and watchful waiting, respectively. Outside Japan, a combination of interferon-Î± and zidovudine has also been used as a therapeutic option for acute, chronic, and smoldering-type ATLs. A Japanese nationwide retrospective study revealed the outcome of patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2009. The median survival times were 8.3, 10.6, 31.5, and 55.0 months and the 4-year overall survival rates were 11%, 16%, 36%, and 52% for acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering-type ATLs, respectively. Recently, the development of several novel agents has been attempted by targeting surface antigens on ATL cells such as CCR4 and CD30 with monoclonal antibodies, targeting molecular abnormalities in ATL cells with EZH1/2 inhibitor, and modulating the immune environment via immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) or immune checkpoint inhibitors. Among them, a CCR4 monoclonal antibody mogamulizumab, and an IMiD, lenalidomide, have been introduced for clinical use in Japan.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), in its acute stage, is a uniformly fatal disease. ATLL is caused by the human T-cell lymphotropic virus I (HTLV-1), a retrovirus endemic in numerous areas throughout the world including Japan, the Caribbean, Central and South America and certain areas of the United States. Although the progression from HTLV-1 carrier status to ATLL occurs only rarely, ATLL is incurable and thus prevention of HTLV-1 transmission should be a primary goal. With the development of new anti-retroviral and monoclonal therapies, there exist potential cures or at least prolonged remissions for patients diagnosed with ATLL. We present a case of ATLL that, to our knowledge, is only the third reported case in Georgia. In addition, we present a brief review of the literature, including potential new treatment regimens that appear to have promise in the treatment of ATLL.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive T-cell lymphoma associated with the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 virus endemic in regions including Japan, the Caribbean islands, and Latin America. Although progress has been made to understand the disease, survival outcomes with current standard therapy remain extremely poor particularly in acute ATLL, underlying the need for better understanding of its biology and identification of novel therapeutic targets. Recently, it was demonstrated that ATLL of North American-descendent patients (NA-ATLL) is both clinically and molecularly distinct from Japanese-descendent (J-ATLL), with inferior prognosis and higher incidence of epigenetic-targeting mutations compared with J-ATLL. In this study, combined chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic profiling were used to further understand the key transcriptional regulators of NA-ATLL compared with J-ATLL. The ETS1 motif was found to be enriched in chromatin regions that were differentially open in NA-ATLL, whereas the AP1/IRF4 motifs were enriched in chromatin regions more open in J-ATLL. ETS1 expression was markedly elevated in NA-ATLL in both cell line and primary tumor samples, and knockdown of ETS1 in NA-ATLL cells resulted in inhibition of cell growth. CCR4, a previously identified oncogenic factor in ATLL, was found to be a direct ETS1 transcriptional target in NA-ATLL. As such, ETS1 provides an alternate mechanism to enhance CCR4 expression/activity in NA-ATLL, even in the absence of activating CCR4 mutations (CCR4 mutations were identified in 4 of 9 NA-ATLL cases). Taken together, this study identifies ETS1 as a novel dominant oncogenic transcriptional regulator in NA-ATLL.Â© 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

      "Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes a range of chronic inflammatory diseases and an aggressive malignancy of T lymphocytes known as adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL). A cardinal feature of HTLV-1 infection is the presence of expanded clones of HTLV-1-infected T cells, which may persist for decades. A high viral burden (proviral load) is associated with both the inflammatory and malignant diseases caused by HTLV-1, and it has been believed that the oligoclonal expansion of infected cells predisposes to these diseases. However, it is not understood what regulates the clonality of HTLV-1 in vivo, that is, the number and abundance of HTLV-1-infected T cell clones. We review recent advances in the understanding of HTLV-1 infection and disease that have come from high-throughput quantification and analysis of HTLV-1 clonality in natural infection.Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a highly aggressive peripheral T-cell malignancy that develops after long-term chronic infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1). Despite the recent advances in chemotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT), and supportive care, the prognosis for patients with ATL is one of the poorest among hematological malignancies; overall survival (OS) at 3 years is only 24 % in the more aggressive subtypes of ATLL. HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus infecting approximately 10-20 million people worldwide, particularly in southern and southeastern Japan, the Caribbean, highlands of South America, Melanesia, and Equatorial Africa. Despite this high frequency of human infection, only 2-5 % of HTLV-1-infected individuals develop ATLL. Three major routes of viral transmission have been established: (1) mother-to-child transmission through breast-feeding; (2) sexual transmission, predominantly from men to women; and (3) cellular blood components. Multiple factors (e.g., virus, host cell, and immune factors) have been implicated in the development of ATLL, although the underlying mechanisms of leukemogenesis have not been fully elucidated. No preventive vaccine against HTLV-1 is currently available, and interrupting the well-recognized primary modes of HTLV-1 transmission is the mainstay of ATLL prevention. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission through the replacement of breast-feeding has been shown to have the most significant impact on the incidence of HTLV-1 infection, and public health policies should consider the risk of malnutrition, especially in developing countries where malnutrition is the significant cause of infant mortality.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma (ATL) is a malignancy of peripheral T lymphocytes caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1), and its prognosis is poor. There are an estimated 5 million to 20 million HTLV-1 infected individuals worldwide; their lifetime risk of developing ATL is 3-5%, and high HTLV-1 proviral loads have been shown to be an independent risk factor. Recent advances in the treatment of ATL are the introduction of treatment targeted against CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), which is abundantly expressed on most ATL cells, and allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation for aggressive ATL. Promising outcomes are also reported with early intervention for indolent ATL with interferon Î± and zidovudine. Clinical trials should incorporate a validated prognostic index to assess the results, because of the difficulties associated with undertaking large-scale trials and significant diversity of clinical features with ATL, even in the same clinical subtypes (acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering).Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is one important treatment option for patients with aggressive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Mogamulizumab (anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody; Mog) was recently approved as a treatment for ATLL in Japan. Major concerns exist about the possible adverse effects of pretransplantation Mog because Mog depletes regulatory T cells for several months. We assessed the impact of pretransplantation Mog on clinical outcomes after allo-HSCT.We included 996 allo-HSCT recipients age 70 years or younger with aggressive ATLL who were given the diagnosis between 2000 and 2013 and who received intensive chemotherapy by multiple chemotherapeutic drugs as first-line therapy. Before allo-HSCT, 82 patients received Mog with a median interval of 45 days from the last Mog to allo-HSCT.Pretransplantation Mog was associated with an increased risk of grade 3 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; relative risk, 1.80; P < .01) and refractoriness to systemic corticosteroid for acute GVHD (relative risk, 2.09; P < .01). One-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was significantly higher in patients with pretransplantation Mog compared with those without (43.7% v 25.1%; P < .01). The probability of 1-year overall survival was also significantly inferior in patients with pretransplantation Mog compared with those without (32.3% v 49.4%; P < .01). In particular, use of Mog with intervals < 50 days to allo-HSCT was associated with a dismal clinical outcome.Pretransplantation Mog was significantly associated with an increased risk of GVHD-related mortality, which supports the relevance of CCR4-expressing Tregs after allo-HSCT in humans. In clinical practice, Mog should be cautiously used for patients with ATLL who are eligible for allo-HSCT.Â© 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a rare disease with a unique geographic distribution. Conducting controlled randomized trials to assess the effective therapeutic strategies has therefore been a significant challenge to date.This review explores the natural history and diagnostic evaluation of ATL, followed by a focused review of existing studies on the most potent individual pharmaceutical agents and combinations used in the therapy of this malignancy. Readers will acquire considerable insights about the clinical subsets, diagnosis and the most effective therapies used in various ATL types.International, multicenter, randomized clinical trials are essential to design optimal therapeutic strategies for various ATL subsets. It appears that patients with acute ATL type benefit considerably from the first-line combined antiviral therapy with zidovudine and interferon alpha, whereas patients with ATL of the lymphoma type may experience a better outcome with intensive chemotherapy. The role of therapy in smoldering and chronic disease types remains to be clarified. In addition, the results of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation in ATL appear promising, as up to 40% of patients who achieve remission and have suitable donors can now become long-term survivors. Prospective evaluation of novel effective agents and their incorporation into various therapeutic algorithms is stringently needed.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive HTLV-1-related malignancy, rare outside of regions where the retrovirus is endemic. Although the use of antiviral therapy has improved outcomes, particularly for indolent forms of ATL, response to combination chemotherapy is poor and outcomes for aggressive subtypes remains dismal. Consolidation with allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) has an increasing role in the management of ATL in eligible patients, offering favourable long-term remission rates. However, relatively high-transplant-related mortality and issues with donor recruitment for certain ethnicities remain problematic. In this review, we discuss the rationale for and issues surrounding alloSCT in ATL in the context of conventional and emerging therapies.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive mature T-cell neoplasm caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. Despite its poor prognosis, there is no standard therapy for ATLL due to its low incidence and the disease affecting only endemic geographical clusters.A retrospective evaluation of patients with the diagnosis of ATLL at Moffitt Cancer Center and Memorial Healthcare System was done to identify patients and disease characteristics along with the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the different therapies used.The 61 patients analyzed showed a median age of 58 with 82.5% of them being of African American descent. The acute variant contributed to the majority of cases (43.9%), followed by 36.8% presenting as a lymphoma variant. There was no statistical difference in the PFS (6.4 m, 3.1 m, 2.1 m; p = 0.23) or OS (14 m, 8.9 m, 18.5 m; p = 0.14) between cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), intensive chemotherapy regimens, and other modalities, respectively. However, the patients who had complete or partial remission with first-line therapy had better OS (15.9 m vs. 7.2 m; p = 0.004).The study highlighted the poor outcome of the current regimens and the lack of a unifying protocol for this vicious disease. The acute variants were treated with more intensive regimens, but there was no difference in the OS between the three major options of CHOP, intensified chemotherapy, and others. This underscores the need for more clinical trials to develop better outcomes.Â© 2023 S. Karger AG, Basel.\n",
      "Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive peripheral T cell neoplasm caused by human T cell lymphotropic/leukemia virus type-1 and has a poor prognosis. A new anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 monoclonal antibody (mogamulizumab) has been shown to be effective for ATLL. Although mogamulizumab is now available in Japan for patients with ATLL, the influence on allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains unclear. Here we report a woman with ATLL resistant to combination chemotherapy, who achieved complete remission following treatment with mogamulizumab and subsequently received allogeneic HSCT. The patient has remained in complete remission with controlled graft-versus-host disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an ATLL patient who received mogamulizumab treatment followed by allogeneic HSCT. We suggest that administration of mogamulizumab to chemotherapy-resistant patients with ATLL may improve their disease status before allogeneic HSCT and result in better survival.\n",
      "ATLL is etiologically associated with HTLV-I retrovirus. A population of 10 to 20 million worldwide is estimated to be infected by the virus, but only 1-4% develop ATLL during a 70-year lifespan. The latency period is more than 30 years. The aim of this study was to report two cases of ATLL in Greek patients with the concomitant study of their family members. A 55-year-old woman and a 59-year-old man presented with leucocytosis and lymphocytosis. Both were asymptomatic and physical examination was unremarkable except for minimal lymphadenopathy in the second patient. In both patients blood smears showed small-to-medium-sized, multilobulated lymphocytes, with different degrees of nuclear irregularity. Immunophenotypic study was as follows: CD2 + (97%), CD3 + (95%), CD5 + (95%), CD3/CD4 + (93%), CD3/CD25 + (84%), CD7 -/CD4 + (89%) CD2 + /HLA-DR + (53%), TCRabeta + (96%) and CD7-(7%). Bone marrow biopsy revealed a normal cellularity with dyserythropoiesis and scattered small lymphocytes (CD4 + on immunostaining) Serum HTLV I and II antibodies were positive. T-cell receptor gamma-chain rearrangement was positive in blood lymphocytes by PCR. Cytogenetic analysis showed complex karyotypic abnormalities. DNA analysis by PCR demonstrated the integration of the HTLV-I DNA in the DNA of the neoplastic T cells. Both patients rapidly developed acute type ATLL. In the first patient multiple subcutaneous nodules on the palmar surface of both hands were also observed. She received deoxycoformycin, which was stopped because of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Corticosteroid treatment was initiated, with gradual improvement. She suffered from recurrent opportunistic infections. She is currently under interferon and zidovudine therapy with stable blood parameters. Chemotherapy was administered to the other patient with > 50% initial response. Both patients' families were tested for serum anti HTLV-I antibodies and their mates were found to be positive; they also had detectable viral DNA by PCR analysis while asymptomatic, with no abnormal clinical findings and normal white blood cell count and morphology. In conclusion, the two aforementioned patients are the first fully documented ATLL patients described in Greece. Investigation for HTLV-I antibodies should be mandatory in all patients with T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.\n",
      "After cell-to-cell transmission, HTLV-I increases its viral genome by de novo infection and proliferation of infected cells. Proliferation of infected cells is clonal and persistent in vivo. During the carrier state, infected cells are selected in vivo by the host's immune system, the genetic and epigenetic environment of proviral integration sites, and other factors. In leukemic cells, tax gene expression is frequently impaired by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Such loss of Tax expression enables ATL cells to escape the host immune system. On the other hand, ATL cells acquire the ability to proliferate without Tax by intracellular genetic and epigenetic changes. Despite advances in support and the development of novel treatment agents, the prognosis for ATLL remains poor. A number of therapies, however, do appear to improve prognosis compared to CHOP (VEPA). These include interferon-alpha plus zidovudine (probably after 1-2 cycles of CHOP), intensive chemotherapy as in LSG-15 with G-CSF support and Allo-SCT (which includes the potential for cure). Emerging novel approaches include HDAC inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and proteasome inhibitors. Comparison between different therapeutic approaches is complicated by the range of natural history of ATLL, different recruitments of naÃ¯ve-to-therapy, refractory or relapsed patients, and variations in the reporting of outcome that frequently excludes difficult-to-evaluate patients. Moreover, results from relatively small proof-of-principle studies have not been extended with randomized, controlled trials. As a result, currently, there is no clear evidence to support the value of any particular treatment approach over others. To avoid further unnecessary patient suffering and to identify optimal therapy as rapidly as possible, large randomized, controlled trials encompassing multicenter, international collaborations will be necessary.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a peripheral T-cell malignancy caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1). Between 3% and 5% of HTLV-1-infected individuals develop ATL after a long latency. Confirmation of seropositivity of anti-HTLV-1 antibody, and clonal proliferation of CD4 and CD25 positive lymphocytes with nuclear pleomorphism in patients suspicious of malignant lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia is crucial for the diagnosis of ATL. The clinical course of ATL is very heterogeneous, and divided into acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The chronic type is further subclassified into the favorable and unfavorable subtypes. Acute, lymphoma, and unfavorable chronic type ATL, and favorable chronic and smoldering type ATL are defined as aggressive and indolent ATL, respectively. Recently identified prognostic indices based on clinical parameters and/or genetic predictors of outcomes need to be confirmed and incorporated for more stratified therapeutic interventions. The standard of care for aggressive ATL is multiagent chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation if possible, while that for indolent ATL is watchful waiting until progression to aggressive ATL. The combination of interferon-Î± and zidovudine is also standard for leukemic type ATL. In addition, mogamulizumab, lenalidomide, and brentuximab vedotin have been incorporated into clinical practices in Japan. Furthermore, several novel drugs are currently undergoing clinical trials.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive neoplasm of T-lymphocytes associated with human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) infection. As HTLV-1 is endemic in native ethnics in South America, and its infection leads to several chronic diseases as ATLL with poor prognosis, we aimed to present three ATLL cases and to review current literature.Two cases were from the mountains of Peru, while one was from an endemic harbor of the country. An acute ATLL patient presented with multipapular infiltration of the skin and died 2 weeks after admission because of septic shock. The two chronic ATLL patients presented with erythematous plaques and erythroderma. They had swollen lymph nodes, lymphocytosis, and atypical lymphocytes on blood smear, with normal biochemical results. They both passed away a few months after diagnosis.ATLL is developed after years of HTLV-1 carrier status; therefore, physicians should know the principal clinical and laboratory findings in order to make prompt diagnosis. Prognosis is still poor in aggressive and indolent variants, with survival rates from months to a few years. Treatment based on chemotherapy, antiretroviral, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation are improving survival rates but with limited results.Â© 2017 The International Society of Dermatology.\n",
      "One in 1000-3000 carriers of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) develops adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) per year; however, the pathogenic mechanism is not completely clear. We have observed that some patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) develop ATLL during treatment at our hospital. The aim of this study was to examine treatment factors associated with onset of ATLL through an evaluation of the therapeutic background of these patients.The impact of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery on occurrence of ATLL was evaluated in 146 patients with head and neck SCC who were treated at our hospital between April 2010 and December 2013.Of 146 patients, 17 were HTLV-1 positive and 6 developed ATLL. There was a significant relationship between ATLL development and administration of S-1 chemotherapy (p=0.0003), but not with use of radiotherapy, surgery or other drugs.The involvement of S-1 chemotherapy in ATLL development suggests that a test for HTLV-1 antibody should be performed before treatment and that S-1 should not be administered in HTLV-1 positive patients with head and neck carcinoma.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

      "The morbidity and mortality of disease vary according to the region and may also change over time. The morbidity and mortality of malignant lymphoma are also affected by differences in ethnicity, lifestyle habits, geographical area, and time period. Increasing research on malignant lymphoma has focused on its pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic treatment. Recent improvements in the accuracy of clinical study, technologies such as next-generation sequencing, and the development of targeted molecular agents have also resulted in a number of excellent studies.

      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a highly aggressive hematologic neoplasm that has an extremely poor prognosis; however, this has improved following recent progress in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Several clinical studies have shown that discontinuation of immunosuppressant therapy induces durable remission in a significant number of post-transplant relapsed patients, suggesting that ATLL may be susceptible to a graft-versus-leukemia effect. Here, we report two cases with ATLL who received donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) for relapse after allo-HSCT; one patient achieved complete remission (CR) after a single DLI, and the other suffered repeated relapses and was treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy combined with a total of five rounds of DLIs. Both patients presented with exacerbation of the graft-versus-host disease after the DLIs, and remained in CR for 9 and 8 years, respectively. These data support the use of DLIs as an effective therapy to induce durable CR in the treatment of relapsed ATLL. In this study, we review previous reports and discuss the role of DLIs in the treatment of post-transplant relapsed ATLL.\n",
      "Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1/TSLC1) was recently identified as a novel cell surface marker for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). In this study, we developed various antibodies as diagnostic tools to identify CADM1-positive ATLL leukemia cells. In flow cytometric analysis, the percentages of CD4(+)CADM1(+) double-positive cells correlated well with both the percentages of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells and with abnormal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with various types of ATLL. Moreover, the degree of CD4(+)CADM1(+) cells over 1% significantly correlated with the copy number of the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) provirus in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1 carriers and ATLL patients. We also identified a soluble form of CADM1 in the peripheral blood of ATLL patients, and the expression levels of this form were correlated with the levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptor alpha. Moreover, lymphomas derived from ATLL were strongly and specifically stained with a CADM1 antibody. Thus, detection of CD4(+)CADM1(+) cells in the peripheral blood, measurement of serum levels of soluble CADM1 and immunohistochemical detection of CADM1 in lymphomas would be a useful set of markers for disease progression in ATLL and may aid in both the early diagnosis and measurement of treatment efficacy for ATLL.\n",
      "In order to identify genomic biomarkers for the outcome of mogamulizumab-containing treatment, an integrated molecular analysis of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) was conducted on 64 mogamulizumab-naÃ¯ve patients. Among driver genes, CCR4 and CCR7 alterations were observed in 22% and 11% of the patients, respectively, both consisting of single nucleotide variants (SNV)/insertion-deletions (indels) in the C-terminus. Patients with CCR4 alterations or without CCR7 alterations exhibited a more favorable clinical response (complete response [CR] rate 93%, 13/14; P=0.024, and CR rate 71%, 40/56; P=0.036, respectively). Additionally, TP53, CD28, and CD274 alterations were identified in 35%, 16%, and 10% of the patients, respectively. TP53 alterations included SNV/indels or copy number variations (CNV) such as homozygous deletion; CD28 alterations included SNV, CNV such as amplification, or fusion; CD274 alterations included CNV such as amplification, or structural variants. Univariate analysis revealed that TP53, CD28 or CD274 alterations were associated with worse overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.330, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.183-4.589; HR: 3.191, 95% CI: 1.287- 7.911; HR: 3.301, 95% CI: 1.130-9.641, respectively) but that CCR4 alterations were associated with better OS (HR: 0.286, 95% CI: 0.087-0.933). Multivariate analysis indicated that in addition to performance status, TP53, CCR4 or CD274 alterations (HR: 2.467, 95% CI: 1.197-5.085; HR: 0.155, 95% CI: 0.031-0.778; HR: 14.393, 95% CI: 2.437-85.005, respectively) were independently and significantly associated with OS.

      "Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive malignancy caused by human T cell lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) without curative treatment at present. To illuminate the pathogenesis of ATLL we performed whole transcriptome sequencing of purified ATLL patient samples and discovered recurrent somatic mutations in CCR4, encoding CC chemokine receptor 4. CCR4 mutations were detected in 14/53 ATLL samples (26%) and consisted exclusively of nonsense or frameshift mutations that truncated the coding region at C329, Q330, or Y331 in the carboxy terminus. Functionally, the CCR4-Q330 nonsense isoform was gain-of-function because it increased cell migration toward the CCR4 ligands CCL17 and CCL22, in part by impairing receptor internalization. This mutant enhanced PI(3) kinase/AKT activation after receptor engagement by CCL22 in ATLL cells and conferred a growth advantage in long-term in vitro cultures. These findings implicate somatic gain-of-function CCR4 mutations in the pathogenesis of ATLL and suggest that inhibition of CCR4 signaling might have therapeutic potential in this refractory malignancy.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive mature T-cell neoplasm caused by infection with the Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1). Cardiac involvement in patients with ATLL is infrequent, and when it happens it is usually seen in aggressive ATLL subtypes. However, ATLL presenting as isolated cardiac valve involvement is extremely rare. To date, only three histologically proven cases of ATLL with isolated cardiac valve involvement have been reported. Herein, we describe a 61-year-old Peruvian man who presented heart failure symptoms secondary to progressive cardiac valve infiltration. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis. Histopathological evaluation of the resected valve revealed leaflet thickening with a nodular appearance due to fibrous tissue containing atypical T-lymphocytes with Foxp3 expression, infiltrating all layers of the resected valve. Interestingly, tumor cells were distributed around an incidental venous malformation (i.e., cavernous hemangioma). Postoperative evaluation demonstrated positive serology for HTLV-1, and a diagnosis of ATLL was established. Postoperative positron emission tomography/computed tomography did not show lesions outside the heart and cell blood counts were within normal range with low level of circulating CD4+ CD25+ lymphoma cell counts (7%); therefore, patient's disease was considered as smoldering ATLL and a \"watch and wait\" strategy was pursued. Currently, the patient is alive with no progression of disease after 18 months from diagnosis. Isolated cardiac valve involvement by ATLL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of HTLV-1 carriers with progressive heart failure, even when systemic lymphoma involvement is absent or not apparent.Copyright Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

      "Iron is an essential nutrient for normal cell growth, and reprogramming of iron metabolism is essential to tumor cell survival and progression. HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) has no effective therapy and high levels of cell surface transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) expression have been reported in ATLL by us and other groups. In this study, to develop a novel molecular-targeted therapy against TFR1 to modulate iron metabolism, we initially determined the expression pattern of several iron-related genes along with TFR1 and found that ATLL cells presented characteristic of an iron-deficiency state such as high expression of iron-regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) and low expression of its E3 ubiquitin-ligase, FBXL5. Therefore, we developed human IgG monoclonal antibodies to human TFR1 using a phage display method (ICOS method) to block the incorporation of the transferrin (TF)-iron complex into ATLL cells for inhibiting cell growth. One of the mAbs, JST-TFR09, presented its greater affinity to TFR1 on ATLL cells in flow cytometry (FCM) analysis than those of commercially available anti-TFR1 antibodies and identified high expression of TFR1 in most of the acute-type ATLL cells. Moreover, JST-TFR09 could interfere with binding between TFR1 and TF, which resulted in effective blockade of TFR1 internalization and induction of cell apoptosis by the treatment of ATLL cells with JST-TFR09. JST-TFR09 showed dual activities through direct cell cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and the treatment of JST-TFR09 significantly suppressed cell growth of ATLL cells with induction of apoptosis in inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo experiments. Thus, JST-TFR09 described here may become a promising therapeutic antibody for the treatment of ATLL.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",
      "CD28, one of the costimulatory molecules, has a pivotal role in T-cell activation, and its expression is strictly regulated in normal T cells. Gain-of-function genetic alterations involving CD28 have been frequently observed in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). These abnormalities, such as CD28 fusions and copy number variations, may not only confer continuous, prolonged, and enhanced CD28 signaling to downstream pathways but also induce overexpression of the CD28 protein. In this study, 120 ATLL cases were examined by immunohistochemistry for CD28 and its ligands CD80 and CD86, and their expression on tumor cells was semiquantitatively evaluated. CD28 was overexpressed in 55 (46%) cases, and CD80 or CD86 (CD80/CD86) was infrequently overexpressed in 12 (11%). Compared with non-overexpressers, CD28 overexpressers showed a higher frequency of CD28 genetic alterations and had an increased number of CD80/CD86-positive non-neoplastic cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment. In the entire ATLL patient cohort, CD28 overexpressers showed a significantly poorer overall survival (OS) compared with non-overexpressers (PÂ =Â .001). The same was true for a subgroup who were treated with multidrug regimens with or without mogamulizumab. CD28 overexpression had no prognostic impact in the group who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the multivariate analysis for OS, CD28 overexpression was selected as an independent risk factor. These results suggest ATLL patients with CD28 overexpression have more aggressive clinical course and are more refractory to treatment with multidrug chemotherapy. CD28 overexpression appears to be a novel unfavorable prognostic marker in ATLL patients, and further prospective studies are warranted to establish its prognostic significance.Â© 2021 The Authors.

      "VCAP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone)-AMP (doxorubicin, ranimustine, and prednisone)-VECP (vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisone) is a standard regimen for aggressive adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL). However, the efficacy of this regimen has not been fully elucidated for patients aged 70 years or older. Here, we retrospectively analyzed elderly patients with aggressive ATL at Nagasaki University Hospital between 1994 and 2010 to assess treatment outcomes. Of 148 evaluable patients, 54 were aged 70 years or older at diagnosis. The median survival time (MST) and overall survival (OS) at 2 years in elderly patients were 10.6 months and 22.1%, respectively. Thirty-four patients received VCAP-AMP-VECP as the initial treatment, although the doses were reduced for most patients. In these patients, MST and OS at 2 years were 13.4 months and 26.6%, respectively. Eleven of 34 patients (32%) received maintenance oral chemotherapy after two or three cycles of VCAP-AMP-VECP, and MST and OS at 2 years were 16.7 months and 32.7%, respectively. Our results suggest that the VCAP-AMP-VECP regimen may be effective and that maintenance oral chemotherapy may be considered as a therapeutic option for elderly patients with aggressive ATL.\n",
      "Multiple lymphomatous polyposis (MLP) is an unusual form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma characterized by polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract. It has been reported that most MLP are observed in cases with mantle cell lymphoma of B-cell type. We herein present a case of a 66-year-old man with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Colonoscopy revealed MLP throughout the colon and histopathological findings of ATLL cell infiltration. The patient died despite combination of chemotherapy. The literature of manifestations of colonic involvement of ATLL is reviewed and the importance of endoscopic evaluation to differentiate ATLL intestinal lesions from opportunistic infectious enterocolitis is discussed.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a generally fatal malignancy. Most ATLL patients fare poorly with conventional chemotherapy; however, antiviral therapy with zidovudine (AZT) and interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) has produced long-term clinical remissions. We studied primary ATLL tumors and identified molecular features linked to sensitivity and resistance to antiviral therapy. Enhanced expression of the proto-oncogene c-Rel was noted in 9 of 27 tumors. Resistant tumors exhibited c-Rel (6 of 10; 60%) more often than did sensitive variants (1 of 9; 11%). This finding was independent of the disease form. Elevated expression of the putative c-Rel target, interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF-4), was observed in 10 (91%) of 11 nonresponders and in all tested patients with c-Rel+ tumors and occurred in the absence of the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax. In contrast, tumors in complete responders did not express c-Rel or IRF-4. Gene rearrangement studies demonstrated the persistence of circulating T-cell clones in long-term survivors maintained on antiviral therapy. The expression of nuclear c-Rel and IRF-4 occurs in the absence of Tax in primary ATLL and is associated with antiviral resistance. These molecular features may help guide treatment. AZT and IFN-alpha is a suppressive rather than a curative regimen, and patients in clinical remission should remain on maintenance therapy indefinitely.\n",
      "Human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV1)-associated adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive malignant disorder. Intensive conventional chemotherapy regimens and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have failed to improve outcomes in ATLL. Allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) is commonly offered as front-line consolidation despite lack of randomized controlled trials. We performed a comprehensive search of the medical literature using PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane reviews on September 10, 2018. We extracted data on clinical outcomes related to benefits (complete response [CR], overall survival [OS], and progression-free survival [PFS]) and harms (relapse and nonrelapse mortality [NRM]), independently by 2 authors. Our search strategy identified a total of 801 references. Nineteen studies (nâ¯=â¯2446 patients) were included in the systematic review; however, only 18 studies (nâ¯=â¯1767 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Reduced intensity conditioning regimens were more commonly prescribed (52%). Bone marrow (50%) and peripheral blood (40%) were more frequently used as stem cell source. The pooled post-allografting CR, OS, and PFS rates were 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57% to 87%), 40% (95% CI, 33% to 46%), and 37% (95% CI, 27% to 48%), respectively. Pooled relapse and NRM rates were 36% (95% CI, 28% to 43%) and 29% (95% CI, 21% to 37%), respectively. The heterogeneity among the included studies was generally high. These results support the use of allo-HCT as an effective treatment for patients with ATLL, yielding pooled OS rates of 40%, but relapse still occurs in over one-third of cases. Future studies should evaluate strategies to help reduce relapse in patients with ATLL undergoing allo-HCT.Copyright Â© 2019 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

      "Mogamulizumab (MOG), a humanized monoclonal anti-CCR4 antibody, exerts strong antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic effects on CCR4-positive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cells. As CCR4 is highly expressed on regulatory T cells as well as ATLL cells, pre-transplant MOG induces severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). However, limited data are available on post-transplant use of MOG for relapsed ATLL. Here we describe the case of a patient with ATLL who experienced post-transplant relapse with involvement of peripheral blood, skin, lungs, and lymph nodes. Neither tacrolimus dose reduction nor cytotoxic chemotherapy was effective, but a single dose of MOG (1Â mg/kg) induced complete remission. After treatment with MOG, leukemic cells in the peripheral blood rapidly disappeared, and the skin, lymph node, and lung lesions gradually regressed. Most notably, the long-term remission was accompanied by recurrence of moderate acute GvHD (grade II, skin stage 2, gut stage 1, liver stage 0). Our findings indicate that MOG can augment allogeneic immune-mediated anti-tumor reactions through graft-versus-ATLL (GvATLL) even during post-transplant relapse involving the lymph nodes and lungs, along with inducing GvHD.Â© 2022.

      "Although treatments for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma in the past two decades have advanced, the current standard treatment for aggressive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, particularly in patients who are not eligible for stem cell transplantation, remains inadequate; therefore, treatments to prolong the duration of remission and provide relevant benefits in terms of survival and quality of life are needed. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma tumor cells express CD30 in some cases and the increased expression of CD30 is considered to be one of the causes of constitutive NF-ÎºB activation in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells. Brentuximab vedotin represents a major breakthrough in the treatment of CD30-positive lymphomas. Elderly patients treated with chemotherapy generally have higher rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events; however a retrospective analysis demonstrated the safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in adults â¥60 years with relapsed and refractory CD30-positive lymphomas. We herein report the clinical effects of brentuximab vedotin and the significance of CD30 expression in an elderly refractory/relapse adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma patient. CD30 expression is associated with disease progression in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma patients and brentuximab vedotin may be a new and promising treatment option for these patients. Further investigations on the use of brentuximab vedotin for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma are needed.\n",
      "We reviewed our experience with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), describing the clinical manifestations and outcome in order to facilitate case recognition in the future.We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 17 patients with ATL diagnosed from January 1996 to September 2009 at Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.The overall survival of the whole study group was 138 days. The medial survival of the 10 patients who received chemotherapy is 204 days. The other six patients who did not receive any chemotherapy had a median survival of 28 days. The co-infection rate with HTLV-1 and HBV or HCV is 47% and 35% respectively.ATL in Taiwan is a rare malignant T-cell lymphoma with a very poor prognosis. Our series raised the interesting possibility of an association with chronic hepatitis B or C.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) has a very bad prognosis and remains resistant to conventional therapy. Promising results have been reported with the combination of zidovudine (AZT) and alpha-interferon (IFN).A combination with IFN and antinucleoside [AZT or zalcitabine (ddC)] was applied since 1995 in Martinique (French West Indies). An initial treatment with two cycles of CHOP was added to reduce initial tumoral burden, followed by antiretroviral (ARV) therapy associated with etoposide. We report the characteristics and outcomes of 29 patients diagnosed with an ATLL between 1990 and 1999. The overall median survival was 8 months. A striking improvement of survival was observed when comparing the periods between 1990-1994 and 1995-1999 (17 months versus 3 months, p = 0.004). During the second period, seven patients received a therapy with oral etoposide, antinucleoside and IFN, among which, six patients received an initial induction CHOP chemotherapy. No major toxicity was observed with this strategy. In conclusion, the progression of survival since 1995 suggests that a therapeutic approach combining initial polychemotherapy with CHOP followed by ARV drugs, IFN and oral etoposide is an interesting option in treating patients with ATLL.\n",
      "The most common subtype of T-/natural killer (NK) cell lymphoma in Japan is adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL), which is associated with the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1). The investigators in Japan have conducted several clinical trials on multi-agent chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation for patients with ATL. They have also initiated several new clinical trials with a number of agents: an anti-CCR4 antibody, KW-0761; forodesine, a purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitor; and lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent. Clinical trials with pralatrexate, a folate analog, and denileukin diftitox, an immunoconjugate, are under discussion for patients with ATL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

      "The efficacy of mogamulizumab in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) was reported in a previous phase 2 study. Compared with patients in clinical trials, however, most patients in real-life settings have demonstrated worse outcomes.We retrospectively analyzed 96 patients with relapsed/refractory ATLL who received mogamulizumab treatment.Relapsed/refractory ATLL patients with a median age of 70Â years received a median of five courses of mogamulizumab. Hematologic toxicity and skin rash were the most common adverse events, and both were manageable. Of 96 patients, 87 were evaluable for efficacy. The overall response rate was 36%, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from the start of mogamulizumab therapy were 1.8 and 4.0Â months, respectively. Of the original 96 patients, only 25 fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the phase 2 study. Those who met the criteria demonstrated longer median PFS and OS durations of 2.7 and 8.5Â months, respectively. The median OS from diagnosis in relapsed/refractory ATLL patients receiving mogamulizumab was 12Â months, longer than the 5.8Â months in a historical cohort without mogamulizumab.In clinical practice, mogamulizumab exhibited antitumor activity in patients with relapsed/refractory ATLL, with an acceptable toxicity profile.

      "The pathogenesis of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-induced adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) was explored using an infectious molecular viral clone and a transgenic mouse model. Activation of nuclear factor-kappaB by the HTLV transcriptional transactivator protein Tax was found to be important for lymphocyte immortalization and tumorigenesis. Interferon-gamma regulates tumor development owing primarily to angiostatic effects. Translational clinical studies of chemotherapy, interferon-alpha, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have also assisted in identifying the pathogenic features of ATLL.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) originates from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection due to the activation of the nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathway to maintain proliferation and survival. An important mechanism of the activated NF-ÎºB signaling pathway in ATLL is the activation of the macroautophagy (herafter referred to as autophagy in the remainder of this manuscript)-lysosomal degradation of p47 (NSFL1C), a negative regulator of the NF-ÎºB pathway. Therefore, we considered the use of chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (CQ/HCQ) as an autophagy inhibitor to treat ATLL; these drugs were originally approved by the FDA as antimalarial drugs and have recently been used to treat autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In this paper, we determined the therapeutic efficacy of CQ/HCQ, as NF-ÎºB inhibitors, in ATLL mediated by blockade of p47 degradation. Administration of CQ/HCQ to ATLL cell lines and primary ATLL cells induced cell growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner, and the majority of cells underwent apoptosis after CQ administration. As to the molecular mechanism, autophagy was inhibited in CQ-treated ATLL cells, and activation of the NF-ÎºB pathway was suppressed with the restoration of the p47 level. When the antitumor effect of CQ/HCQ was examined using immunodeficient mice transplanted with ATLL cell lines, CQ/HCQ significantly suppressed tumor growth and improved the survival rate in the ATLL xenograft mouse model. Importantly, HCQ selectively induced ATLL cell death in the ATLL xenograft mouse model at the dose used to treat SLE. Taken together, our results suggest that the inhibition of autophagy by CQ/HCQ may become a novel and effective strategy for the treatment of ATLL.\n",
      "Treatment options for patients with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) who have relapsed disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are limited. To clarify which patients with ATLL are likely to benefit from these treatment options and to define patient populations for novel treatments, we performed a nationwide retrospective analysis of 252 Japanese patients who had relapsed ATLL after allo-HSCT. Some long-term survivors remained after tapering and withdrawal of immunosuppressive agents. Thirty-six patients who received donor lymphocyte infusion had a better overall survival (OS) in comparison to those who did not [hazard ratio (HR), 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43-0.93; PÂ =Â .02], suggesting the efficacy of a graft-versus-ATLL (GvATLL) effect even after relapse. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that skin lesions at initial relapse of ATLL were independently associated with higher OS (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.22-0.74; PÂ =Â .003), indicating that the skin is a susceptible target organ of GvATLL. This study suggested that enhancement of a GvATLL effect is a potential therapeutic option for relapsed disease after allo-HSCT. Further investigations of incorporation of immune-based approaches with new molecular target drugs into the therapeutic options of patients with ATLL before and after transplantation are warranted.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a highly invasive and refractory T-cell malignancy, with poor prognosis. We previously identified that cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) is overexpressed consistently in ATLL cells, and that CADM1 expression increases the adhesion capacity of ATLL cells to endothelial cells and promotes the organ invasion of ATLL cells in a xenograft mouse model. In this study, we first show that newly developed several anti-human CADM1 antibodies, which were complete human IgG antibodies generated by phage display method, specifically recognize CADM1 on ATLL cells. Although most of the CADM1 antibodies did not have a direct cytotoxic effect against CADM1-positive ATLL cells, clone 089-084 exhibited weak but significant antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic activity. Moreover, clone 103-189 effectively inhibits the interaction between endothelial cells and CADM1-positive ATLL cells. Furthermore, in mice bearing intra-splenic transplantation of EL4 mouse lymphoma cells expressing CADM1, the treatment of 103-189 significantly suppressed the organ invasion of CADM1-positive EL4 cells, resulting in improved survival time of mice. Therefore, since the anti-CADM1 antibody may be useful for the suppression of organ invasion in ATLL patients, combination use of the anti-CADM1 antibody with chemotherapy drugs could be beneficial for the efficient elimination of ATLL cells.\n",
      "Acute or lymphomatous type adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive hematopoietic malignancy with poor prognosis. We previously reported that programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression could predict ATLL outcomes. However, the roles of other immune checkpoint molecules remain largely unknown in ATLL. Our aim in this study was to explore the clinicopathological impacts of immune checkpoint molecules in ATLL. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 69 ATLL patients with antibodies against the following: PD-L1, programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), OX40, OX40 ligand (OX40L), CD137, CD137 ligand (CD137L), Galectin-9, T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3), cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), lymphocyte activating-3 (LAG-3), CD80, CD86, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein (GITR), GITR ligand (GITRL), and programmed death-1 (PD-1). Immune checkpoint molecules were variably expressed on neoplastic and/or microenvironmental cells. Expression of PD-1, OX40L, Galectin-9, and PD-L1 was nearly mutually exclusive on neoplastic cells, suggesting that immune checkpoint pathways differ in patients. Microenvironmental expression of PD-L1, OX40L, and Tim-3 was significantly associated with better overall survival (log-rank test; Pâ=0.0004, 0.0394, and 0.0279, respectively). Univariate and multivariate analyses with clinical prognostic factors identified microenvironmental expression of PD-L1 and OX40L, and age (>â70Â years) as significant prognostic factors. This is the first comprehensive analysis of ATLL immune checkpoint molecules. Our results may provide information on new therapeutic strategies in ATLL.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a highly aggressive haematological malignancy. More than 40 cases of ATLL treated by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from sibling donors have been reported, while there have been only a few cases of unrelated BMT for treatment of this disease. We began performing allogeneic BMT from unrelated donors in 1999 to improve the outcome of ATLL patients with no suitable sibling donors. Eight ATLL patients underwent unrelated BMT; five received the conventional conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, while three received a reduced-intensity preparative regimen. Two patients died due to encephalopathy of unknown aetiology on days 10 and 35, and one patient died due to progression of ATLL 25 months after BMT. Five patients are currently alive and disease-free at a median of 20 months after BMT. Proviral human T-lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) DNA load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was assessed in four cases before and after BMT. HTLV-I proviral DNA load was reduced significantly after transplantation. Unrelated BMT is feasible for treatment of ATLL. Further studies in a larger number of cases are required to determine the optimal conditioning regimen and stem cell source.\n",
      "We describe three cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) with duodenal involvement and provide a review of the literature. The first case, a 74-year-old woman with acute subtype of ATLL, had multiple polypoid lesions from the bulbus extending into the descending portion of the duodenum. The second case, a 70-year-old man with lymphoma subtype of ATLL, had a polypoid tumor in the descending portion of the duodenum and multiple protruded lesions in the small and large intestines. The third case, a 67-year-old man with lymphoma subtype of ATLL, had a flat-elevated lesion in the descending portion of the duodenum, as well as a gastric ulcerated lesion. Biopsies from these lesions showed mucosal invasion of ATLL cells in each case. All patients received combination chemotherapy, which was successful in the first and third cases, accompanied by the disappearance of gastroduodenal lesions.\n",
      "Human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type 1 (HTLV-1) induces aberrant nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. Although Tax is thought to play major roles in NF-kappaB activation, cells expressing Tax become a target of cytotoxic T cells. Accordingly, HTLV-1-infected cells lose Tax expression and acquire Tax-independent NF-kappaB activation. Blocking NF-kappaB not only induces apoptosis in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells but also reduces the number of HTLV-1-infected cells in virus carriers. Therefore, because constitutively activated NF-kappaB appears to be the common biological basis shared between HTLV-1-infected untransformed cells and ATL cells, blocking NF-kappaB might be a potential strategy for treating and preventing ATL.\n",
      "The c-fms proto-oncogene is also known as macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) or colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), and is expressed on several types of malignant tumor cells and myeloid cells. In the present study, we found that overexpression of M-CSFR was present in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cases. M-CSFR signaling was associated with lymphoma cell proliferation, and M-CSFR inhibition induced apoptosis in lymphoma cells. The ATLL cell line ATL-T expressed M-CSF/CSF-1 and interleukin (IL)-34, which are both M-CSFR ligands. M-CSF and IL-34 expression was seen in ATLL cases, and co-expression of these ligands was detected in 11 of 13 ATLL cases. M-CSFR inhibition suppressed programmed death-1 and -2 ligand in ATL-T cells and macrophages stimulated with conditioned medium from ATL-T cells. Thus, an M-CSFR inhibitor may be useful as additional therapy against ATLL due to direct and indirect mechanisms.\n",

      "Adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL) is a chemotherapy-resistant malignancy with a median survival of less than one year that will afflict between one hundred thousand and one million individuals worldwide who are currently infected with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Recurrent somatic mutations in host genes have exposed the T-cell receptor pathway through nuclear factor ÎºB to interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) as an essential driver for this malignancy. We sought to determine if IRF4 represents a therapeutic target for ATLL and to identify downstream effectors and biomarkers of IRF4 signaling in vivo.ATLL cell lines, particularly Tax viral oncoprotein-negative cell lines, that most closely resemble ATLL in humans, were sensitive to dose- and time-dependent inhibition by a next-generation class of IRF4 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that employ constrained ethyl residues that mediate RNase H-dependent RNA degradation. ATLL cell lines were also sensitive to lenalidomide, which repressed IRF4 expression. Both ASOs and lenalidomide inhibited ATLL proliferation in vitro and in vivo. To identify biomarkers of IRF4-mediated CD4â+âT-cell expansion in vivo, transcriptomic analysis identified several genes that encode key regulators of ATLL, including interleukin 2 receptor subunits Î± and Î², KIT ligand, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, and thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group protein TOX 2.These data support the pursuit of IRF4 as a therapeutic target in ATLL with the use of either ASOs or lenalidomide.\n",
      "Human T cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1) causes the functionally debilitating disease HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) as well as adult T cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL). Although there were concerns that the mortality of HAM/TSP could be affected by the development of ATLL, prospective evidence was lacking in this area. In this 5-y prospective cohort study, we determined the mortality, prevalence, and incidence of ATLL in 527 HAM/TSP patients. The standard mortality ratio of HAM/TSP patients was 2.25, and ATLL was one of the major causes of death (5/33 deaths). ATLL prevalence and incidence in these patients were 3.0% and 3.81 per 1,000 person-y, respectively. To identify patients at a high risk of developing ATLL, flow cytometry, Southern blotting, and targeted sequencing data were analyzed in a separate cohort of 218 HAM/TSP patients. In 17% of the HAM/TSP patients, we identified an increase in T cells positive for cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), a marker for ATLL and HTLV-1-infected cells. Genomic analysis revealed that somatic mutations of HTLV-1-infected cells were seen in 90% of these cases and 11% of them had dominant clone and developed ATLL in the longitudinal observation. In this study, we were able to demonstrate the increased mortality in patients with HAM/TSP and a significant effect of ATLL on their prognosis. Having dominant clonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells with ATLL-associated somatic mutations may be important characteristics of patients with HAM/TSP who are at an increased risk of developing ATLL.Copyright Â© 2020 the Author(s).

      "Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a rare, extremely aggressive malignancy with four different clinical variants, all of which are associated with human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1. Antiretrovirals have been recognized as an effective therapy after study in clinical trials around the world. However, oncologists traditionally wait for asymptomatic patients with ATLL to reach a more severe stage of disease before treatment is initiated. We describe a patient with Fitzpatrick Skin Type V who presented with asymptomatic dyschromia of her neck, breast, and jaw. Her clinical, laboratory, and histological findings were consistent with smoldering type-ATLL. We teamed up with her oncologist to successfully treat her cutaneous symptoms with interferon-alpha/zidovudine.

      "Acute adult T-cellleukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a hematologic malignancy that usually entails a poor prognosis; median survival is only six months. Significant immunosuppression is commonly seen in these patients. Lung involvement in ATLL is usually documented either radiographically or as an autopsy finding. Few proven cases of ante mortem extensive lung infiltration have been described in the scientific literature. We present a fatal case of acute respiratory failure as a result of histologically proven lung infiltration by malignant lymphocytes in a patientwith acuteATLL. Although the most common cause of death i n patients with ATLL is respiratory failure in the setting of an infectious process, it should be kept in mind that patients with ATLL with acute respiratory failure may have malignant lung infiltration as a potential cause.\n",

We next administrated MT-2 cells into 13-month-old marmosets under cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment to promote infection. HTLV-1 infection was determined by measuring HTLV-1 antibody titer in the common marmosets.The HTLV-1 antibody titer increased in the intraperitoneally inoculated marmoset with or without CsA treatment, and it kept over five 5Â years though proviral copy number (proviral load, PVL) remained low throughout the study.We obtained HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers of common marmosets by inoculating MT-2 cells.Â© 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

GSK-3Î² blockade downregulates the NF-ÎºB pathway, modulates immune cell PD-1 and tumor cell PD-L1 expression, and increases CD8Â +Â T cell and NK cell function. We report a case of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) treated with 9-ING-41, a selective GSK-3Î² inhibitor in clinical development, who achieved a durable response. A 43-year-old male developed diffuse lymphadenopathy, and biopsy of axillary lymph node showed acute-type ATLL. Peripheral blood flow cytometry revealed a circulating clonal T cell population, and CSF was positive for ATLL involvement. After disease progression on the 3rd line of treatment, he started treatment with 9-ING-41 monotherapy in a clinical trial (NCT03678883). CT imaging after seven months showed a partial response. Sustained reduction of peripheral blood ATLL cells lasted 15Â months. Treatment of patient-derived CD8Â +Â T cells with 9-ING-41 increased the secretion of IFN-Î³, granzyme B, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). In conclusion, treatment of a patient with refractory ATLL with the GSK-3Î² inhibitor 9-ING-41 resulted in a prolonged response. Ongoing experiments are investigating the hypothesis that 9-ING-41-induced T cell activation and immunomodulation contributes to its clinical activity. Further clinical investigation of 9-ING-41 for treatment of ATLL is warranted.\n",
      "To evaluate therapeutic activity of PAK inhibition in ATLL and to characterize the role of PAK isoforms in cell proliferation, survival, and adhesion of ATLL cells in preclinical models.Frequency and prognostic impact of PAK2 amplification were evaluated in an ATLL cohort of 370 cases. Novel long-term cultures and in vivo xenograft models were developed using primary ATLL cells from North American patients. Two PAK inhibitors were used to block PAK kinase activity pharmacologically. siRNA-based gene silencing approach was used to genetically knockdown (KD) PAK1 and PAK2 in ATLL cell lines.PAK1/2/4 are the three most abundantly expressed PAK family members in ATLL. PAK2 amplifications are seen in 24% of ATLLs and are associated with worse prognosis in a large patient cohort. The pan-PAK inhibitor PF-3758309 (PF) has strong in vitro and in vivo activity in a variety of ATLL preclinical models. These activities of PF are likely attributed to its ability to target several PAK isoforms simultaneously because genetic silencing of either PAK1 or PAK2 produced more modest effects. PAK2 plays a major role in CADM1-mediated stromal interaction, which is an important step in systemic dissemination of the disease. This finding is consistent with the observation that PAK2 amplification is more frequent in aggressive ATLLs and correlates with inferior outcome.PAK2, a gene frequently amplified in ATLL, facilitates CADM1-mediated stromal interaction and promotes survival of ATLL cells. Taken together, PAK inhibition may hold significant promise as a targeted therapy for aggressive ATLLs.Â©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.\n",
      "An 84-year-old patient with adult T cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL) developed diarrhea on day 5 of chemotherapy and was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis. Sigmoidoscopy revealed multiple superficial erosions surrounded by a flare. Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonogram of the abdomen revealed marked thickening of the colonic mucosa. There were 186 CMV antigen-positive leukocytes per 31,000 white blood cells (WBC). A colonic biopsy specimen showed typical CMV nuclear inclusions. Immunohistological study of the specimen was positive for CMV antigen. Administration of ganciclovir (DHPG) 500 mg/day for 14 days improved the diarrhea and other symptoms. On day 30 of the chemotherapy, the patient developed diarrhea again but was diagnosed with pseudomembranous colitis instead of CMV colitis. At that time, CMV antigenemia and a histologic study for CMV were negative. The stool was positive for Clostridium difficile toxin antigen. ATLL patients are believed to be immunocompromised hosts and often develop opportunistic infections such as CMV infection. Most suffer from CMV pneumonia at the end of their course of therapy. Few gastrointestinal (GI) CMV infections are seen in ATLL patients and details of CMV colitis have never been reported. When an ATLL patient develops diarrhea that barely responds to conventional therapy, CMV colitis and pseudomembranous colitis should be listed in the differential diagnosis.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) relapse is a serious therapeutic challenge after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed 35 patients who experienced progression of or relapsed persistent ATL after a first allo-SCT at 3 institutions in Nagasaki prefecture (Japan) between 1997 and 2010. Twenty-nine patients were treated by the withdrawal of immune suppressants as the initial intervention, which resulted in complete remission (CR) in 2 patients. As the second intervention, 9 patients went on to receive a combination of donor lymphocyte infusion and cytoreductive therapy and CR was achieved in 4 patients. Of 6 patients who had already had their immune suppressants discontinued before the relapse, 3 patients with local recurrence received local cytoreductive therapy as the initial treatment, which resulted in CR for more than 19 months. Donor lymphocyte infusion-induced remissions of ATL were durable, with 3 cases of long-term remission of more than 3 years and, interestingly, the emergence or progression of chronic GVHD was observed in all of these cases. For all 35 patients, overall survival after relapse was 19.3% at 3 years. The results of the present study suggest that induction of a graft-versus-ATL effect may be crucial to obtaining durable remission for ATL patients with relapse or progression after allo-SCT.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is a mature T-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasm caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 infection. There is no standard treatment for relapsed or refractory (r/r) ATL, and clinical outcomes are poor. This systematic review examined the survival outcomes for r/r ATL treated with various systemic therapies.EMBASE and PubMed were searched for studies on r/r ATL, published between January 2010 and January 2020. The main outcome of interest was overall survival (OS). Median OS and an exploratory 30% OS time were assessed based on published data and Kaplan-Meier curves.There were 21 unique treatment subgroups (from 14Â studies), that met the eligibility criteria. Nine subgroups were mogamulizumab treatment, two were mogamulizumab prior to allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), five were allo-HSCT, and five were other chemotherapy. Respectively, the median OS and 30% OS varied considerably in range for mogamulizumab treatment (2.2-17.6Â months and 8.7-27.1Â months), allo-HSCT (3.8-6.2Â months and 7.5-19.8Â months), and other chemotherapy arms (4.1-20.3Â months and 7.1-17.0Â months).Mogamulizumab was the most frequently studied treatment regimen and can potentially provide longer survival compared with chemotherapy alone. Future comparisons with synthetic or historical control arms may enable clearer insights into treatment efficacy.Â© 2021 Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.

      "A 74-year-old woman with refractory adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) received three courses of mogamulizumab. Despite obtaining complete remission, she thereafter presented with progressive ascites. An analysis of the ascites and laboratory tests revealed no evidence of ATLL invasion, infectious disease, or liver cirrhosis. The mogamulizumab concentrations were maintained in the ascites at approximately 10-15% of that in the plasma. Mogamulizumab was considered to be a plausible pathogenesis of her ascites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting mogamulizumab-induced ascites.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is caused by the HTLV-1 virus, endemic to Japan and the Caribbean, and is likely derived from cells with the T-regulatory phenotype. The malignant cells express IL2 receptor Î± (CD25), and the majority express transcription factor Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), in addition to T-cell markers. Occasional cases express CD30. Whereas Japanese cases are predominantly of the acute and chronic leukemic types, the less well-studied Caribbean cases are more often lymphomatous. We performed immunohistochemical analysis for CD25, Foxp3, and CD30 on samples from 42 US/Caribbean ATLL patients and correlated these markers with morphologic subtype and clinical characteristics. In the 16/42 patients who had successive biopsies, we determined the expression stability of these markers. Foxp3 was expressed in 26 of the 42 (62%) initial biopsies, and its intensity correlated with CD25 expression. It was more frequent in pleomorphic small-sized and medium-sized cell types than in large cell tumors but did not correlate with patients' clinical attributes. Foxp3 expression and morphology were unchanged in successive biopsies in 13 of 16 patients. Four initial biopsies had features of anaplastic large cell T lymphomas, all of which were Foxp3. Successive biopsies from 2 patients with pleomorphic medium cell variant showed diminishing expression of originally weak Foxp3 expression and de novo CD30 expression, whereas they showed morphologic progression to the anaplastic cell variant. A third patient's second biopsy revealed progression from pleomorphic medium to anaplastic large cell morphology with loss of Foxp3, but it remained CD30. Foxp3 expression correlates with pleomorphic small and medium cell types and may be lost with large cell transformation. The evolution of the latter type can be associated with the gain of CD30 expression; such ATLL tumors might respond to anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody therapies.\n",
      "Allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (allo-HSCT) is a curative treatment for aggressive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Considering the dismal prognosis associated with conventional chemotherapies, early application of allo-HSCT might be beneficial for patients with ATLL. However, no previous study has addressed the optimal timing of allo-HSCT from related donors. Hence, to evaluate the impact of timing of allo-HSCT for patients with ATLL, we retrospectively analyzed data from patients with ATLL who received an allo-HSCT from a related donor. The median age was 52 years. Patients were grouped according to the interval from diagnosis to allo-HSCT: early transplant group, <100 days, n=72; late transplant group, â©¾100 days, n=428. The corresponding constituents of disease status were not statistically different between the two groups (P=0.11). The probability of OS in the early transplant group was significantly higher than that in the late transplant group (4-year OS, 49.3% vs 31.2%). Multivariate analysis revealed that late allo-HSCT was an unfavorable prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-2.11; P=0.04). Despite the limitations of a retrospective study, it might be acceptable to consider early application of allo-HSCT for ATLL.\n",
      "Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) with or without interferon-a (IFN) was given to 4 patients with relapsed/refractory adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Treatment with As2O3 and IFN showed an encouraging response in two moderately-aggressive ATLL patients, while As2O3 alone was ineffective in two patients with very aggressive and rapidly progressing ATLL. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of As2O3 and its usefulness when combined with IFN for the treatment of ATLL.\n",
      "Primary adrenal lymphoma (PAL) is very rare; the majority of cases reported previously were of B-cell origin. We report a rare case of primary adrenal adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (primary adrenal ATLL). ATLL is a highly aggressive T-cell type non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and etiologically associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1). Most ATLL patients present with leukemia and widespread lymphadenopathy. A 37-year-old Japanese woman presented with back pain in January 2004. Examination showed no peripheral lymphadenopathy, circulating lymphoma cells, hepatosplenomegaly, and skin lesions. Imaging studies demonstrated large adrenal masses bilaterally. Subsequently, she underwent open adrenal biopsy and pathological diagnosis was confirmed as T-cell lymphoma. The serum antibody to HTLV-1 was positive. Southern blot analysis detected monoclonal integration of proviral DNA of HTLV-1 into host genome in the biopsy specimen. The diagnosis of ATLL arising in adrenal glands was established. Despite repeated systemic chemotherapy, the patient died of progressive disease in December 2004. ATLL could primarily involve the adrenal gland and this disease entity should be included in the differential diagnosis of adrenal mass lesions.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a mature (post-thymic) T-cell lymphoma associated with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 infection. Survival in aggressive subtypes remains poor, and treatment resistance is frequent. Use of zidovudine (ZDV) and interferon alfa (IFN-Î±) has been associated with improved response rates in small studies and prolonged overall survival in leukemic ATLL subtypes in a recent meta-analysis.We report the clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment, and outcome of 73 patients with aggressive ATLL (acute ATLL, 29; lymphoma ATLL, 44) diagnosed and treated in England between 1999 and 2009. The impact of ZDV/IFN-Î± on treatment response and survival was assessed.The overall response rate ranged from 49% with chemotherapy alone to 81% with combined first-line therapy (chemotherapy with concurrent/sequential ZDV/IFN-Î±). Median overall survival (OS) was 9 months: 7.5 months for acute ATLL and 10 months for lymphoma ATLL. Use of ZDV/IFN-Î± at any time prolonged survival in acute (P < .001) and lymphoma ATLL (P < .001) and was the sole factor associated with reduction in risk of death in aggressive ATLL (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.60; P = .002). Combined first-line therapy prolonged median OS in acute (P = .0081) and lymphoma ATLL (P = .001) compared with chemotherapy alone.These data support the use of low-dose ZDV/IFN-Î± with chemotherapy in first-line treatment of acute and lymphoma ATLL.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an intractable hematologic malignancy caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), which infects approximately 20 million people worldwide. Here, we have explored the possible expression of cancer/testis (CT) antigens by ATLL cells, as CT antigens are widely recognized as ideal targets of cancer immunotherapy against solid tumors. A high percentage (87.7%) of ATLL cases (n = 57) expressed CT antigens at the mRNA level: NY-ESO-1 (61.4%), MAGE-A3 (31.6%), and MAGE-A4 (61.4%). CT antigen expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. This contrasts with other types of lymphoma or leukemia, which scarcely express these CT antigens. Humoral immune responses, particularly against NY-ESO-1, were detected in 11.6% (5 of 43) and NY-ESO-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses were observed in 55.6% (5 of 9) of ATLL patients. NY-ESO-1-specific CD8(+) T cells recognized autologous ATLL cells and produced effector cytokines. Thus, ATLL cells characteristically express CT antigens and therefore vaccination with CT antigens can be an effective immunotherapy of ATLL.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) often involves the skin. Cases with skin lesions without either leukemic nor lymph node involvement have been categorized into a cutaneous type. While the clinical manifestations of the cutaneous-type ATLL are variable, including multiple papules, nodules, plaques, or erythroderma, a solitary skin nodule alone is rare, and only 2 cases have been reported in the literature. We present a 58-year-old Japanese patient with cutaneous-type ATLL that presented as a large, solitary skin nodule as the sole clinical feature. The skin tumor was completely resolved after treatment with x-ray and electron beam irradiation.\n",
      "The rarity of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in China, coupled with its clinicopathologic mimicry of primary skin disease, poses a diagnostic challenge. The method of diagnosis and mechanism of immune regulation in ATLL are discussed in the present report.A 51-year-old Chinese man was admitted to the hospital with 2-years history of systemic plaque lesions and 1-year history of left ankle joint pain.The patient was diagnosed with ATLL based on the results of flow cytometry immunophenotype and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) serology.The patient received 3 cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin/ vinorelbine, and dexamethasone (CHOP) chemotherapy. However, he relapsed and did not respond to epirubicin, vindesine, etoposide, dexamethasone (EPOCH) chemotherapy.His family discontinued the treatment and opted for hospice care.Patch and plaque ATLL types exhibits a better survival rate, but atypical skin patches delays the diagnosis of ATLL and negatively affects the patient survival. Based on the present findings, we suggest that patients with petal-like nuclear lymphocytes in blood smears, a high CD4: CD8 ratio, and strong CD25 expression should undergo HTLV-1 serology testing.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is a highly aggressive peripheral T-cell neoplasm caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection occurring in approximately 5% of patients after prolonged latent period. ATL relapses within a short period despite its transient response to multiagent chemotherapy and the prognosis is extremely poor due to anticancer drug resistance and immunodeficiency. Although novel agents with different mechanisms, such as molecular targeted agents, have improved the prognosis, the number of cured patients remains limited. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation resulted in long-term remission, whereas its indication is limited due to treatment-related mortality. As most ATL patients are of advanced age, development of a lesser toxic treatment is necessary. Therefore, we developed a novel therapeutic dendritic cell vaccine targeting the HTLV-1 Tax antigen. The safety profile has been confirmed in a pilot and phase I clinical studies, and a promising long-term clinical efficacy has also been obtained. This novel vaccine is a noninvasive, long-lasting therapy for ATL and can potentially be extended to different applications for low-grade ATL and high-risk HTLV-1 carriers.\n",
      "Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1Â (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphomaÂ (ATLL) but there is no effective treatment for HTLV-1-associated diseases. Herein, we determined the effect of butein, a bioactive plant polyphenol, on cell growth, apoptosis and signaling pathways in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and on tumor growth in SCID mice. Treatment with butein caused a decrease in viability of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. TÂ cells cultured with butein showed obvious apoptosis morphology, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase with activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9. Pretreatment of cells with caspase inhibitor partially blocked butein-induced inhibition of cell viability. Butein also resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1Â phase. Butein markedly downregulated the protein expression levels of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin E, survivin, XIAP, c-IAP2 and phospho-pRb. Butein also inhibited i) total and phospho-protein levels of IÎºB kinase (IKK)Î± and IKKÎ², ii) degradation and phosphorylation of IÎºBÎ±, iii) JunB and JunD, iv) total and phospho-protein levels of Akt, v) phosphorylation of RelA, vi)Â heat shock proteinÂ 90, and vii) DNA-binding activity of NF-ÎºB and AP-1. In mice harboring ATLL xenograft tumors, butein caused a significant inhibition of tumor growth and reduced serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptorÂ Î± chain and soluble cluster of differentiationÂ 30. Considered together, the results indicated that butein has antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties through the suppression of NF-ÎºB, AP-1 and Akt signaling in HTLV-1-infected TÂ cells, both inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo, suggesting its therapeutic potential against HTLV-1-associated diseases including ATLL.\n",
      "Few publications exist concerning allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) outcomes in non-Japanese patients with HTLV-1-associated ATLL. We detail the patient and disease characteristics, transplant approach, and clinical outcomes in 17 patients with ATLL at our institution who underwent alloHCT. We report favorable outcomes, with 8/17 in ongoing remission, 2/17 with prolonged (>6âyears) disease-free survival, and a low incidence of transplant-related mortality (2/17). These results validate the feasibility and efficacy of alloHCT in non-Japanese patients with ATLL.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a peripheral T-cell lymphoma caused by the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I. Patients with aggressive ATL show dismal prognoses, even with intensive dose-dense chemotherapy. Such patients often show chemo-refractoriness. Mogamulizumab (Moga) is a potent treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory ATL. However, use of Moga before allo-HSCT could theoretically increase the risk of post-transplant complications like graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as Moga depletes regulatory T-cells (Tregs). We retrospectively assessed the impact of Moga on post-transplant outcomes using data from a nationwide survey. Pre-transplant administration of Moga was associated with an increased risk of grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD and refractoriness to systemic corticosteroid for acute GVHD. The one-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was significantly higher in patients who were treated with Moga pre-transplant compared with those who were not (43.7% vs. 25.1%, P<0.01). The probability of one-year overall survival was also significantly lower in patients with pre-transplant Moga use compared to those without (32.3% vs. 49.4%, P<0.01). In summary, pre-transplant Moga was significantly associated with an increased risk of GVHD-related mortality, which supports the relevance of CCR4-expressing Tregs after allo-HSCT in humans.\n",
      "Only some carriers of human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) develop adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) after a long latency period, and an association has been reported between chronic refractory eczema, known as infective dermatitis, and young-onset ATLL. A 25-year-old female developed ATLL and underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in non-remission. She had chronic refractory eczema and corneal injury at the onset of ATLL. Remission of ATLL was achieved, and the HTLV-1 proviral load decreased after HSCT. In addition, her pre-existing eczema and corneal injuries almost disappeared. More than a year has passed since the transplantation was performed, and she has had no recurrence of either ATLL or lesions in the skin and eye. Her clinical course suggests a possible association between skin and eye lesions and HTLV-1 infection. Changes in the immunological condition after HSCT might play a key role. Special attention is needed when HTLV-1 carriers develop eye or skin lesions.\n",
      "Human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infects 15-20 millions individuals worldwide. This oncoretrovirus can be transmitted through 3 ways: horizontally, vertically (mother to child) and via blood transfusion. HTLV-1 causes 2 major diseases: adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy. Tax is a 40-kDa phosphoprotein that is encoded by the pX region of the virus. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated a central role for this protein in the immortalization or transformation of the HTLV-1 infected cells. Apart from its ability to drive transcription from the viral promoter, it also deregulates the cell cycle, inhibits apoptosis, has an effect on the maintenance of the genomic stability and induces the production of several cytokines. In addition, several arguments strongly suggest the existence of host genetic factors, that could be involved in the HTLV-1 infection as well as in the development of ATLL among HTLV-1 infected individuals. ATLL can be classified into 4 major subtypes: a smoldering type, a chronic type, a lymphoma type and a leukemic type. The demonstration by Southern blot analysis of the clonal integration of an HTLV-1 provirus in the tumoral cells represents the gold-standard to define biologically ATLL. The survival rate of ATLL patients, especially those who develop the acute leukemic or lymphomas forms, is very poor, and such clonal malignant CD4 expansion remains one of the most severe lymphoproliferations.\n",

      "Infection by human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) causes deregulation of the immune system, which makes the infected individuals more susceptible to infectious diseases. Immune deregulation is even more pronounced in HTLV-1 carriers with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), which results in frequent opportunistic infections. Hyalohyphomycosis is a rare subcutaneous mycosis which is more commonly associated with immunocompromised patients. We report a case of a HTLV-1-infected man with skin tumors, inguinal lymphadenomegaly, and lymphocytosis. Histopathological examination of skin biopsies revealed a T-cell lymphoma intermingled with a granulomatous process with abscesses and hyaline-septated hyphae. The lymph node showed only a T-cell lymphoma. The patient was diagnosed with acute ATLL and hyalohyphomycosis. He was treated with itraconazole for the subcutaneous mycosis and with chemotherapy for ATLL. A few months later, despite the treatment, he died because of progression of ATLL.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) type 1-associated disease of TCD4+Â cell transformation. Despite extensive studies on ATLL development and progression, the fundamental processes of HTLV-1 oncogenicity are yet to be understood. This study aimed to integrate high-throughput microarray datasets to find novel genes involved in the mechanism of ATLL progression. For this purpose, five microarray datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and then profoundly analyzed. Differentially expressed genes and miRNAs were determined using the MetaDE package in the R software and the GEO2R web tool. The STRING database was utilized to construct the protein-protein interaction network and explore hub genes. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis were carried out by employing the EnrichR web tool. Furthermore, flow cytometry was employed to assess the CD4/CD8 ratio, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to confirm the high-throughput data analysis results. Four miRNAs, including hsa-mir-146, hsa-mir-451, hsa-mir-31, and hsa-mir-125, were among the statistically significant differentially expressed miRNAs between healthy individuals and ATLL patients. Moreover, 924 differentially expressed genes were identified between normal and ATLL samples. Further network analysis highlighted 59 hub genes mainly regulating pathways implicated in viral interferences, immunological processes, cancer, and apoptosis pathways. Among the identified hub genes, RhoA and PRKACB were most considerable in the high-throughput analysis and were further validated by qRT-PCR. The RhoA and PRKACB expression were significantly down-regulated in ATLL patients compared to asymptomatic carriers (p<0.0001 and p=0.004) and healthy subjects (p=0.043 and p=0.002). Therefore, these corresponding miRNAs and proteins could be targeted for diagnosis purposes and designing effective treatments.Copyright Â© 2022. Published by Elsevier B.V.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) has a very poor prognosis. We have developed the humanized defucosylated anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) monoclonal antibody KW-0761 as a next generation immunotherapeutic agent. The first aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the antitumor activity of KW-0761 would likely be sufficient for therapeutic clinical application against ATLL. The second aim was to fully elucidate the mechanism of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by this defucosylated monoclonal antibody.The antitumor activity of KW-0761 against ATLL cell lines was evaluated in vitro using human cells and in mice in vivo. Primary ATLL cells from 23 patients were evaluated for susceptibility to autologous ADCC with KW-0761 by two independent methods.KW-0761 showed potent antitumor activity against ATLL cell lines both in vitro and in the ATLL mouse model in vivo. In addition, KW-0761 showed potent antitumor activity mediated by highly enhanced ADCC against primary ATLL cells both in vitro and ex vivo in an autologous setting. The degree of KW-0761 ADCC against primary ATLL cells in an autologous setting was mainly determined by the amount of effector natural killer cells present, but not the amount of the target molecule CCR4 on the ATLL cell surface.KW-0761 should be sufficiently active for therapeutic clinical application for ATLL. In addition, combination treatment strategies that augment natural killer cell activity should be promising for amplifying the effect of KW-0761. In the near future, the actual efficacy of KW-0761 will be established in pivotal clinical trials.\n",
      "Adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and Î²2 microglobulin (Î²2M) serve as key molecules in tumour immunity, and their expression is reduced frequently in tumour cells. Programmed cell death (PD)-1/PD-ligand1 (PD-L1) interactions play a role in escape of tumour cells from T cell immunity. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the clinicopathological relevance of HLA and Î²2M expressions in ATLL cells and PD-L1 expression in lymphoma or stromal cells and predict the overall survival of patients with ATLL.We analysed a total of 123 biopsy samples from patients newly diagnosed with ATLL by using immunohistochemical analysis. Of the patients enrolled, 91 (74%) were positive for HLA (in cell membrane, 60 patients), 89 (72%) were positive for Î²2M (in cell membrane, 54 patients) and 48 (39%) were positive for both HLA and Î²2M in the cell membrane (HLAm+ Î²2Mm+ ). No significant clinical differences other than prognosis were found between the HLAm+ Î²2Mm+ group and the other groups. Immunophenotypical evaluation revealed significantly higher rates of CD30-positive lymphoma cells (P = 0.003) and PD-L1-positive stromal cells in microenvironments (miPD-L1high ) (P = 0.011) of the HLAm+ Î²2Mm+ group than in the other groups. The HLAm+ Î²2Mm+ group had a significantly better prognosis that the other groups (P = 0.0096), and patients showing HLAm+ Î²2Mm+ with miPD-L1high had the most favourable prognosis among all groups.The membranous expression of HLA and Î²2M is likely to reflect the immune response and would be useful to predict prognosis before starting ATLL therapy.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n",
      "Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) is a human oncoretrovirus known to cause adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Coinfection of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) results in enhanced expression of the HTLV virus and leads to aggressive organ involvement from T-cell malignancy. It has also been observed that the prevalence of hepatitis B infection has been higher in patients with HTLV ATLL as compared with the general population in certain countries. We describe a case of a 34-year-old man who initially presented with leucocytosis, fatigue and conjunctival erythema. His radiological images revealed significant generalised adenopathy, and his flow cytometry analysis came back positive for CD4-positive T-cell lymphoma. He was subsequently diagnosed with HTLV-positive ATLL. Ultimately the patient was also diagnosed with acute hepatitis B and EBV.

We present the features of 4 ATLLs diagnosed at our North American tertiary care medical center from 1990 to 2012. Despite the absence of a history of origin from an endemic region, all our ATLLs demonstrated evidence of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 infection. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement by ATLL was uncommon in our series, and represented only 1.6% (1/64) of all CNS B-cell or T-cell lymphomas diagnosed over a 20+ year period at our institution. Review of the medical literature reveals that the majority of CNS-involved ATLLs present with the lymphoma or acute subtype, and complete remission is difficult to achieve in these cases. CNS involvement frequently occurs with a systemic disease, which carries an aggressive clinical course with poor prognosis. In addition, CNS involvement by ATLL can be the initial presentation or seen with relapsed disease, can be the only site or be associated with other tissue sites of involvement, and may manifest with variable clinical signs/symptoms. Our retrospective study reveals that ATLLs are rare mature T-cell lymphomas in a native North American population, but the clinical and histopathologic features of ATLLs from this nonendemic region are similar to those seen from other endemic regions. Early recognition of these rare ATLLs involving uncommon sites, such as the CNS, will help optimize treatment for these infrequent mature T-cell lymphomas.\n",
      "Bowenoid papulosis (BP) is a premalignant condition usually caused by oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV) presenting clinically as warty genital papules. Adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma (ATLL) is a peripheral T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma caused by the retrovirus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1). We report a case of BP initially mistaken as genital warts; on detailed evaluation the patient had features of chronic immunosuppression. The presence of leukaemic cells in the peripheral blood, bone marrow and skin along with a positive HTLV-1 serology confirmed the diagnosis of ATLL.\n",
      "Little information exists regarding the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). We evaluated 75 peripheral blood samples from 17 ATLL cases using flow cytometry (FC); 50 of the samples were concurrently evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for clonal T-cell receptor gamma chain (TRG) gene rearrangement and the presence of human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 proviral sequences. Residual ATLL cells were identified using a multiparametric approach to identify aberrant T-cell immunophenotypes. Malignant T cells were CD4+, CD3 dim+, CD26-, CD25 bright, CD7+, and CD27+, with occasional dim expression of CD2 or CD5. FC exhibited a high sensitivity, detecting as few as 0.29% ATLL cells/WBC (4.9 cells/microL) in the peripheral blood. PCR for TRG gene rearrangement was slightly more sensitive, and FC and PCR complemented each other in detecting MRD. In 2 patients, there was complete remission; 4 patients had disease refractory to therapy, and 3 died; 11 others had persistent disease with variable numbers of ATLL cells in the peripheral blood. Higher levels of ATLL cells appeared to correlate with disease severity. FC detection of aberrant T cells permits sensitive and quantitative monitoring of MRD in ATLL.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive malignancy of mature activated T cells caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I. ATL carries a bad prognosis because of intrinsic chemoresistance and severe immunosuppression. In acute ATL, Japanese trials demonstrated that although combinations of chemotherapy improved response rate, they failed to achieve a significant impact on survival. Patients with chronic and smoldering ATL have a better prognosis, but long-term survival is poor when these patients are managed with a watchful-waiting policy or with chemotherapy. Recently, a worldwide meta-analysis revealed that the combination of zidovudine and IFN-Î± is highly effective in the leukemic subtypes of ATL and should be considered as standard first-line therapy in that setting. This combination has changed the natural history of the disease through achievement of significantly improved long-term survival in patients with smoldering and chronic ATL as well as a subset of patients with acute ATL. ATL lymphoma patients still benefit from chemotherapy induction with concurrent or sequential antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine/IFN. To prevent relapse, clinical trials assessing consolidative targeted therapies such as arsenic/IFN combination or novel monoclonal antibodies are needed. Finally, allogeneic BM transplantation should be considered in suitable patients.\n",
      "Congenital ichthyosis is an uncommon spectrum of hereditary and sporadic hyperkeratotic epidermolytic disorders that may occur in isolation or in association with other clinical syndromes. The pattern of distribution of the hyperkeratotic lesions and family history form the basis of diagnosis. Ichthyosis may be a marker for immune deficiency and cancer prone conditions. We report a 16-year old Chinese patient with a diagnosis of ichthyosis hystrix hystrix (disseminated congenital naevus) since birth who presented with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with tetraploid clones. There are four reports of acute leukaemia complicating ichthyosis, all involving paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The possible mechanisms involved are discussed.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is aggressive mature T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder with a poor outcome.We present 10 patients with acute and lymphomatous subtypes of ATLL treated with distinct induction regimens, including CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine [Oncovin], prednisone or prednisolone), interferon/zidovudine, and VCAP-AMP-VECP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone; doxorubicin, ranimustine, prednisone; vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, prednisone).The overall response rate was 50%, with 10% complete remission (CR). Two patients achieved CR with the second-line regimen. Three patients underwent consolidation with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in the first CR. The median overall survival was 51Â months for the entire group and 84 months for the patients who had undergone ASCT versus 34 months for the non-ASCT patients.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

      "Adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an intractable T cell neoplasm caused by human T cell leukaemia virus type 1. Next-generation sequencing-based comprehensive mutation studies have revealed recurrent somatic CCR4 mutations in ATLL, although clinicopathological findings associated with CCR4 mutations remain to be delineated. In the current study, 184 cases of peripheral T cell lymphoma, including 113 cases of ATLL, were subjected to CCR4 mutation analysis. This sequence analysis identified mutations in 27% (30/113) of cases of ATLL and 9% (4/44) of cases of peripheral T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified. Identified mutations included nonsense (NS) and frameshift (FS) mutations. No significant differences in clinicopathological findings were observed between ATLL cases stratified by presence of CCR4 mutation. All ATLL cases with CCR4 mutations exhibited cell-surface CCR4 positivity. Semi-quantitative CCR4 protein analysis of immunohistochemical sections revealed higher CCR4 expression in cases with NS mutations of CCR4 than in cases with wild-type (WT) CCR4. Furthermore, among ATLL cases, FS mutation was significantly associated with a poor prognosis, compared with NS mutation and WT CCR4. These results suggest that CCR4 mutation is an important determinant of the clinical course in ATLL cases, and that NS and FS mutations of CCR4 behave differently with respect to ATLL pathophysiology.Copyright Â© 2016 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

      "128 cases of ATL (adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma) were divided into 3 subgroups, 70 cases of acute type, 19 cases of chronic type and 39 cases of lymphoma type, and their prognosis were evaluated. Median survival time from the onset of acute type using Kaplan-Meier method was 8 months, that of lymphoma type was 14 months and that of chronic type was 50 months. Median survival time from the start of treatment of acute type was 5 months, that of lymphoma type was 11 months and that of chronic type was 22 months. Relatively short median survival time of chronic type may be due to they had some duration with observation only at first. No significant elongation of survival time could be obtained when acute type was divided into 2 stages, before and after 1982. Twelve patients with non-Hodgkins' lymphoma unresponsive to the first line combination chemotherapy were treated with combination therapy with cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (CDDP). Ten patients were evaluable for response (4 cases of CR, 6 cases of PR). To stop the HTLV-1 carrier mothers milk for giving their children seems to be effective method to decrease the occurrence of ATL in future.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a largely incurable disease. Cutaneous involvement is common and could be first symptom of the disease. We analyzed 169 patients with ATLL of whom 63 had cutaneous involvement. Cutaneous involvement was found in 48, 27, 17, and 60% of acute, lymphomatous, chronic and smoldering ATLL cases, respectively. Eight cases had primary cutaneous tumoral variant. Erythroderma (24%) and plaques (22%) were the most frequent skin lesions. The presence of cutaneous involvement was associated with better overall survival compared to non-cutaneous involvement (aHR 0.55 [95% CI: 0.37-0.82], pâ<â0.01; 1-year OS 53 vs. 27%, respectively, pâ=â0.012). Combination zidovudine and interferon-alpha (AZT-IFN) yielded high response rates (overall response, OR = 100%, nâ=â8; complete response 62.5%) compared to chemotherapy (OR = 33.3%, nâ=â12/36). In conclusion, cutaneous involvement was associated with better survival in Latin American patients with ATLL. AZT-IFN demonstrated encouraging responses in ATLL patients with cutaneous involvement.\n",
      "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive disease caused by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Real-world data of ATLL in Latin America are lacking.We analyzed patients with ATLL (acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering) encountered in 11 Latin American countries between 1995 and 2019. Treatment response was assessed according to the 2009 consensus report. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.We identified 253 patients; 226 (lymphomatous: n = 122, acute: n = 73, chronic: n = 26, and smoldering: n = 5) had sufficient data for analysis (median age 57 years). Most patients with ATLL were from Peru (63%), Chile (17%), Argentina (8%), and Colombia (7%). Hypercalcemia was positively associated with acute type (57% v lymphomatous 27%, P = .014). The median survival times (months) were 4.3, 7.9, 21.1, and not reached for acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering forms, with 4-year survival rates of 8%, 22%, 40%, and 80%, respectively. First-line zidovudine (AZT)-interferon alfa (IFN) resulted in an overall response rate of 63% (complete response [CR] 24%) for acute. First-line chemotherapy yielded an overall response rate of 41% (CR 29%) for lymphomatous. CR rate was 42% for etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone versus 12% for cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone-like regimen (P < .001). Progression-free survival at 1 year for acute type patients treated with AZT-IFN was 67%, whereas 2-year progression-free survival in lymphomatous type patients who achieved CR after chemotherapy was 77%.This study confirms Latin American ATLL presents at a younger age and has a high incidence of lymphomatous type, low incidence of indolent subtypes, and worse survival rates as compared with Japanese patients. In aggressive ATLL, chemotherapy remains the preferred choice for lymphomatous favoring etoposide-based regimen (etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone), whereas AZT-IFN remains a good first-line option for acute subtype.\n",
      "To the authors' knowledge, an association between adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been reported only in four patients. The authors identified five additional patients with both neoplasms.A review of the clinical records of patients with AML, ATL, or lymphoid neoplasms other than ATL diagnosed between 1986 and 1995 was performed. Cytokine levels were assayed in selected patients. The authors searched for reports from other institutions using MEDLINE and the proceedings of two Japanese hematology societies.ATL was diagnosed in 134 patients, whereas 180 had AML. Five patients with both neoplasms were identified (3.7% of ATL patients and 2.8% of AML patients). In seven of the nine patients (including four patients in the literature) with ATL and AML, the ATL was diagnosed prior to the AML, whereas in the remaining two patients both neoplasms were diagnosed simultaneously. Six of the nine cases were therapy-related (t)-AML, which developed after chemotherapy for ATL. Monoclonal integration of proviral human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 was detected in ATL cells but not in AML cells in the six patients examined. The plasma levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were elevated in 3, 1, and 1, respectively, of the 4 patients examined at AML onset who had active ATL. In one case, the levels of several cytokines, including GM-CSF and M-CSF, in the supernatant fluid of short term cultured ATL cells were elevated. Three patients with de novo ATL and AML received remission induction therapy, and two achieved a complete remission (CR) of both diseases. Among the four patients who received chemotherapy for t-AML, two achieved CR.ATL patients also can develop AML, irrespective of treatment with chemotherapy for ATL. This association does not indicate exclusive chemoresistance of both neoplasms. Cytokines produced by ATL cells may support the growth of AML cells.\n",
      "Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive peripheral T cell neoplasm with very poor prognosis. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has been reported as a curative treatment modality for ATL. However, there are no reports comparing chemotherapy alone with allo-HSCT in ATL. In this report, we retrospectively analyzed data for patients treated with (n = 29, median age 55 years) or without allo-HSCT (n = 37, median age 58 years) for ATL in Kagoshima University Hospital, located in one of the most endemic areas of human T cell lymphotropic leukemia virus type 1 infection. Forty patients (61%) started coordination for allo-HSCT. Ten patients (34.4%) received allo-HSCT while in complete remission (CR), whereas the others were not in CR. Twenty-five patients (86.2%) received reduced-intensity conditioning, and the others received myeloablative conditioning. With a median follow-up period for survivors of 41 months (range, 5 to 125 months), the 3-year overall survival (OS) rate from first chemotherapy for all patients (with or without allo-HSCT) was 35.2%. The 3-year OS from first chemotherapy for patients who received allo-HSCT or only chemotherapy was 44.9% and 27.7%, respectively. Univariate analyses revealed that high serum soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels (â¥ 2000 U/mL) just before the conditioning regimen and progressive disease (PD) status at HSCT (according to Japan Clinical Oncology Group Study 0907 criteria) were significant risk factors for OS in the allo-HSCT group. Multivariate analyses revealed that PD status was a significant risk factor for OS in the allo-HSCT group. In the chemotherapy-only group, the 3-year OS rate was 61.5% (95% CI, 30.8% to 81.8%) in patients with serum sIL-2R levels < 2000 U/mL for > 3 months. In contrast, the 3-year OS rate was 5.7% (95% CI, .4% to 22.4%) in patients who did not achieve serum sIL-2R levels < 2000 U/mL for >3 months. Our single-center cohort experience indicates that chemosensitivity is the most important prognostic factor for OS in ATL patients and the use of allo-HSCT is limited in chemorefractory patients with aggressive ATL disease. In the chemosensitive patients, allo-HSCT demonstrated a tendency toward better OS. Further clinical studies are warranted to determine optimal treatments for patients who are less sensitive to conventional chemotherapy.Copyright Â© 2015 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

      "MST-16, a new orally administered bis(2,6-dioxopiperazine) analogue and an inhibitor of topoisomerase II, was given to 24 patients with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) in a Phase I-II multi-institutional cooperative study.MST-16 was administered orally daily for 7 days, with courses repeated at intervals of 2-3 weeks in 24 patients.Two complete remissions (CR) and eight partial remissions (PR) were obtained in 23 evaluable patients who received 1200-2800 mg/day of MST-16. Among 13 acute-type ATLL, one CR and five PR were obtained. Among eight lymphoma-type ATLL, two PR were detected. Among two chronic-type ATLL, one CR and one PR occurred. Remissions were obtained at 7-232 days (median, 23 days) and lasted 43-374 days (median, 68 days). The major toxic effects were leukopenia (68%), anemia (52%), thrombocytopenia (35%), and gastrointestinal disorders (22%).MST-16 was shown to be effective in ATLL, which has no standard therapy. This drug deserves further clinical trials because it shows little cross resistance to currently available antitumor drugs.\n",
      "Despite the remarkable advances in chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is still associated with a high mortality rate. It is therefore essential to elucidate the current features of ATL.We retrospectively analyzed 81 patients with aggressive type ATL at our institution over a 7-year period based on Shimoyama's diagnostic criteria.Eighty-one patients with a median age of 67.5 years were classified as having acute (n=47), lymphoma (n=32), or chronic type (n=2) ATL. They were initially treated by either palliative therapy (n=25) or systemic chemotherapy [n=56; cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) therapy (n=25)/vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VCAP)-doxorubicin, ranimustine, and prednisone (AMP)-vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisone (VECP) therapy (VCAP-AMP-VECP) or CHOP-VMMV therapy (n=31)], and showed median survival durations of 16 and 277 days, respectively. Subsequent to the initial treatment, HSCT (n=6) was performed for certain patients, thus revealing that two-thirds (n=4) relapsed, and one-third (n=2) survived for 131 days and 203 days, respectively. The relapsed ATL patients were treated with conventional salvage therapy (n=29) or anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 antibody (mogamulizumab) (n=3). The patients treated with mogamulizumab demonstrated complete response (2) and partical response (1) with short duration periods of 82 days, 83 days, and 192 days, respectively. Among the five long-term survivors (>5 years) who received chemotherapy, most showed a low and intermediate risk according to the ATL prognostic index.In our study, the overall survival of ATL remains poor due to the advanced age of the patients at diagnosis, a high proportion of patients receiving palliative therapy, and a small proportion of long-term survivors receiving chemotherapy and undergoing HSCT. This study illustrates the current clinical features, treatment strategies, and outcomes in clinical practice.\n",
      "Acute liver failure (ALF) is a medical emergency requiring immediate evaluation for liver transplantation. We describe an unusual case of a patient who presented with ascites, jaundice, and encephalopathy and was found to have ALF due to natural killer (NK)-like T cell leukemia/lymphoma. The key immunophenotype was CD2+, CD3+, CD7+, CD56+. This diagnosis, which was based on findings in the peripheral blood and ascitic fluid, was confirmed with liver biopsy, and was a contraindication to liver transplantation. A review of the literature shows that hematologic malignancies are an uncommon cause of fulminant hepatic failure, and that NK-like T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is a relatively recently recognized entity which is characteristically CD3+ and CD56+. This case demonstrates that liver biopsy is essential in diagnosing unusual causes of acute liver failure, and that infiltration of the liver with NK-like T-cell lymphoma/leukemia can cause acute liver failure.\n",

      "|\"Antivirals\" in the treatment of adult T cell leukaemia- lymphoma (ATLL).|10.1007/s11899-012-0139-9|  23093306 |Adult T cell leukaemia / lymphoma (ATLL) is a mature (post thymic) T cell lymphoma caused by the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. Overall survival in the aggressive subtypes (Acute Leukaemia and Lymphomatous) remains poor in part due to chemotherapy resistance. To improve treatment outcome for de novo disease, better induction therapies are required and since the pathogenic agent is known it would seem sensible to target the virus. In a recent meta-analysis the use of zidovudine and interferon alpha (ZDV/IFN) has been associated with improved response rates and prolonged overall survival in leukemic subtypes of ATLL (both acute and Chronic) confirmed in a multivariate analysis. In a more recent UK study the overall response rate for patients with aggressive ATLL treated with chemotherapy alone was 49Â % compared to 81Â % with combined first line therapy (chemotherapy with concurrent or sequential ZDV/IFN). Combined first line therapy prolonged median OS in acute (pâ=â0.0081) and lymphomatous ATLL (pâ=â0.001).These data support the use of low dose ZDV/IFN with chemotherapy as first line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed aggressive ATLL. Although the mechanisms of action are incompletely understood, some possible explanations for their efficacy will be discussed.|\n",

      "|Rapid T-cell lymphoma progression associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.|10.1080/17474086.2023.2215424|  37191476 |Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are widely used for multiple types of malignancies and are considered the fourth pillar in cancer treatment. Anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab are approved for relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Nonetheless, two phase 2 trials for T-cell lymphoma were terminated because of hyperprogression after a single dose in some patients.In this review, we summarize available information on the rapid progression of peripheral T-cell lymphoma including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL).In the abovementioned two trials, disease subtypes in patients who experienced hyperprogression were mostly ATLL or angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Possible hyperprogression mechanisms induced by PD-1 blockade are the compensatory upregulation of the expression of other checkpoints, altered expression of lymphoma-promoting growth factors, functional blockade of stromal PD-ligand 1 acting as a tumor suppressor, and unique immune environment in indolent ATLL. The differentiation between hyperprogression and pseudoprogression is practically essential. There are no established methods to predict hyperprogression before administration of an ICI. In the future, the progress of novel diagnostic modalities such as positron emission tomography with computed tomography and circulating tumor DNA is expected to facilitate early cancer detection.|\n",

      "|Genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies CDK6 as a therapeutic target in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.|10.1182/blood.2021012734|  34818414 |Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive T-cell malignancy with a poor prognosis with current therapy. Here we report genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening of ATLL models, which identified CDK6, CCND2, BATF3, JUNB, STAT3, and IL10RB as genes that are essential for the proliferation and/or survival of ATLL cells. As a single agent, the CDK6 inhibitor palbociclib induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ATLL models with wild-type TP53. ATLL models that had inactivated TP53 genetically were relatively resistant to palbociclib owing to compensatory CDK2 activity, and this resistance could be reversed by APR-246, a small molecule activator of mutant TP53. The CRISPR-Cas9 screen further highlighted the dependence of ATLL cells on mTORC1 signaling. Treatment of ATLL cells with palbociclib in combination with mTORC1 inhibitors was synergistically toxic irrespective of the TP53 status.

HTLV-1 and HIV-1 are frequent co-pathogens, however, despite its potential for accelerated progression of HIV disease and the risk of developing adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL), HTLV-1 is seldom considered for investigation in the HIV-1 positive individual. Severe/refractory hypercalcaemia, unresponsive to conventional calcium lowering therapy may complicate up to 70% of cases of ATLL. In addition, HTLV-1 and ATLL have both been associated with a rise in dysfunctional CD4 lymphocytes, thereby conveying a false sense of immune competence in the HIV-1 infected individual.|\n",

Clinical manifestations of ATLL range from smoldering to chronic, lymphoma and acute. Patients with acute and lymphoma type ATLL require therapeutic intervention. Conventional chemotherapeutic regimens used against other malignant lymphoma have been administered to ATLL patients, but the therapeutic outcomes of acute and lymphoma type ATLL remain very poor. Promising results of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for ATLL patients have recently been reported and the treatment outcome might be improved for some ATLL patients. Besides conventional chemotherapy and SCT, interferon, zidovudine, arsenic trioxide, targeted therapy against surface molecule on ATLL cells, retinoid derivatives, and bortezomib have been administered to ATLL patients in pilot or phase I/II studies. Further studies are required to confirm the clinical benefits of these novel therapeutics. This article reviews the current status and future directions of ATLL treatment.|\n",

Because CCR4 is expressed on normal regulatory TÂ cells as well as on ATLL cells, MOG may accelerate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) by eradicating regulatory TÂ cells in patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). However, there is limited information about its safety and efficacy in patients treated with MOG before allo-HSCT. In the present study, 25 patients with ATLL were treated with MOG before allo-HSCT, after which 18 patients (72%) achieved remission. The overall survival and progression-free survival at 1Â year post-transplantation were 20.2% (95% CI, 6.0% to 40.3%) and 15.0% (95% CI, 4.3% to 32.0%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD was 64.0% (95% CI, 40.7% to 80.1%) for grade II-IV and 34.7% (95% CI, 15.8% to 54.4%) for grade III-IV. The cumulative incidence of transplantation-related mortality (TRM) was 49.0% (95% CI, 27.0% to 67.8%). Six of 7 patients with acute GVHD grade III-IV died from GVHD, which was the leading cause of death. In particular, a shorter interval from the last administration of MOG to allo-HSCT was associated with more severe GVHD. MOG use before allo-HSCT may decrease the ATLL burden; however, it is associated with an increase in TRM due to severe GVHD. Because MOG is a potent anti-ATLL agent, new treatment protocols should be developed to integrate MOG at suitable doses and timing of administration to minimize unwanted GVHD development.Copyright Â© 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

Aggressive ATLL is refractory to conventional chemotherapy and has a poor prognosis. Better therapeutic approaches, including cancer immunotherapy, are required to improve survival and prognosis. The genetic landscape of ATLL reveals frequent genetic alterations in genes associated with immune surveillance, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, CD58 antigen, and programmed cell death ligand 1. Clinicopathological investigations also revealed tumor immunity mechanisms in ATLL, including immune checkpoint molecules, MHC molecules, tumor-associated macrophages, and chemokines. However, the tumor microenvironment of ATLL remains complex because ATLL itself originates from T-cells, usually expressing regulatory T-cell markers. In this review, we discuss the recent literature describing the tumor microenvironment of ATLL.|\n",

HTLV-1 was brought to the World Health Organization (WHO) and researchers to address its impact on global public health, oncogenicity, and deterioration of the host immune system toward autoimmunity. In a minority of the infected population (3-5%), it can induce inflammatory networks toward HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), or hijacking the infected CD4+ T lymphocytes into T regulatory subpopulation, stimulating anti-inflammatory signaling networks, and prompting ATLL development. This review critically discusses the complex signaling networks in ATLL pathogenesis during virus-host interactions for better interpretation of oncogenicity and introduces the main candidates in the pathogenesis of ATLL. At least two viral factors, HTLV-1 trans-activator protein (TAX) and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ), are implicated in ATLL manifestation, interacting with host responses and deregulating cell signaling in favor of infected cell survival and virus dissemination. Such molecules can be used as potential novel biomarkers for ATLL prognosis or targets for therapy. Moreover, the challenging aspects of HTLV-1 oncogenesis introduced in this review could open new venues for further studies on acute leukemia pathogenesis. These features can aid in the discovery of effective immunotherapies when reversing the gene expression profile toward appropriate immune responses gradually becomes attainable.|\n",

Although ATLL is quite difficult to be cured, up-regulation of cellular immunity such as HTLV-1 Tax-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) has been proved to be important to obtain long-term survival. At present, no efficacious method to activate ATLL-specific cellular immunity is available. This study aimed to investigate whether live attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccination to ATLL can activate HTLV-1 Tax-specific cellular immune response. A total of 3 indolent- and 3 aggressive-type ATLL patients were enrolled. All aggressive-type patients had the VZV vaccination after completing anti-ATLL treatment including mogamulizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody for C-C chemokine receptor 4 antigen, plus combination chemotherapy, whereas all indolent-type patients had the VZV vaccination without any antitumor treatment. Cellular immune responses including Tax-specific CTLs were analyzed at several time points of pre- and post-VZV vaccination. After the VZV vaccination, a moderate increase in 1 of 3 indolent-type patients and obvious increase in all 3 aggressive-type patients in Tax-specific CTLs percentage were observed. The increase in the cell-mediated immunity against VZV was observed in all indolent- and aggressive-type patients after VZV vaccination. To conclude, VZV vaccination to aggressive-type ATLL patients after mogamulizumab plus chemotherapy led to the up-regulation of HTLV-1 Tax-specific CTLs without any adverse event. Suppression of regulatory T lymphocytes by mogamulizumab may have contributed to increase tumor immunity in aggressive-type ATLL patients.

      "|[Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma].|10.3960/jslrt.17008|  36181532 |Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an extremely refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma that develops after persistent human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. In recent years, the number of HTLV-1 carriers has decreased due to lifestyle changes and different measures. Rapid progression in comprehensive genetic analysis techniques has revealed the molecular basis of ATL. Therefore, in addition to conventional prognostic indices based on clinical parameters, prognostic indices incorporating genetic mutations have been proposed. The standard treatment for untreated aggressive ATL is combination chemotherapy such as VCAP-AMP-VECP or CHOP, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as appropriate. Combined mogamulizumab and chemotherapy is a promising first-line treatment option for patients not eligible for transplantation. Salvage treatment with lenalidomide, brentuximab vedotin, tucidinostat, and valemetostat, in addition to mogamulizumab, has been introduced over the last decade. Advancements in allogeneic transplantation therapy, including early induction and transplantation with post-transplant cyclophosphamide for GVHD prophylaxis, have also improved patient outcomes. This article highlights recent developments in the field of ATL.|\n",

Several new therapies for ATL have since been developed, i.e. dose-intensity multi-agent chemotherapies, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), monoclonal antibodies, and anti-viral therapy. The monoclonal antibody to CCR4, mogamulizumab, clearly improved response rates in patients with treatment-naÃ¯ve and relapsed aggressive ATL, and has the potential to provide a survival advantage. The outcomes of allo-HSCT have been reported since the early 2000s. High treatment-related mortality was initially the crucial issue associated with this treatment approach; however, reduced intensity conditioning regimens have decreased the risk of treatment-related mortality. The introduction of allo- HSCT has had a positive impact on the prognosis of and potential curability with treatments for ATL. A meta-analysis of a treatment with interferon-Î± and zidovudine (IFN/AZT) revealed a survival benefit in patients with the leukemic subtype. A phase 3 study comparing IFN/AZT with watchful waiting in patients with indolent ATL is ongoing in Japan. Several clinical trials on novel agents are currently being conducted, such as the histone deacetylase inhibitors, alemtuzumab, brentuximab vedotin, nivolumab, and an EZH1/2 dual inhibitor.|\n",

However, mogamulizumab could increase graft-versus-host disease, resulting in poor survival outcome in the allogenic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) setting. It is possible that the efficacy of mogamulizumab could be established by the occurrence of skin rashes and/or CCR4 mutational status.

HTLV-1 is endemic to certain geographic areas of the world, and primary infection generally occurs in infancy through mother-to-child transmission via breastfeeding. In less than 5% of infected individuals, a decades-long pathogenic process culminates in the development of ATL. Aggressive subtypes of ATL are life-threatening and challenging to treat, with median overall survival typically less than 1 year in the absence of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Owing to the rarity of this illness, prospective large-scale clinical trials have been challenging to perform, and treatment recommendations are largely founded upon limited evidence. Herein, we review the current therapeutic options for ATL, providing a broad literature overview of the foremost clinical trials and reports of this disease. We emphasize our own treatment paradigm, which is broadly based upon disease subtype, patient fitness, and intent to perform alloHCT. Finally, we highlight recent advances in understanding ATL disease biology and important ongoing clinical trials that we foresee as informative and potentially practice-changing.Â© 2023.

Prognosis of ATL patients is directly correlated to the subtype of ATL. Treatment of the aggressive forms (acute and lymphoma types) of ATL remains inadequate, as most ATL patients receive conventional chemotherapy without stem cell rescue. At present, LSG15 is the standard chemotherapy for the treatment of aggressive ATL, but the efficacy of LSG15 in most patients is transient. To prolong median survival time, additional therapies for maintenance of complete response (CR) are needed after achieving CR by induction chemotherapy. Improved outcome after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), despite a high incidence of graft-versus-host disease, has been reported. Thus, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and allogeneic peripheral blood SCT may have great potential for eradication of HTLV-1 and cure of ATL. Recently, reduced-intensity conditioning stem cell transplantation was also reported to be effective for ATL. Although several issues, including selection criteria for patients and sources of stem cells remain to be resolved, allo-SCT may be considered as a treatment option for patients with aggressive ATL. To evaluate whether allo-SCT is more effective than the standard chemotherapy (LSG15) for aggressive ATL, an up front phase II clinical trial of JCOG-LSG is now being planned. Novel innovative targeted strategies, such as antiretroviral therapy, arsenic trioxide, nuclear factor-kappaB inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, several monoclonal antibodies including anti-CC chemokine receptor 4, anti-folate, purine nucleotide phosphorylase inhibitor, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor, bendamustine, small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitors and Tax-targeted immunotherapy, should be promptly studied in order to develop curative treatments for ATL in the near future.|\n",

In order to identify favorable prognostic patients after intensive chemotherapy, and who therefore might not require upfront allo-HSCT, we aimed to improve risk stratification of aggressive ATL patients aged <70 years. The clinical risk factors and genetic mutations were incorporated into risk modeling for overall survival (OS). We generated the m7-ATLPI, a clinicogenetic risk model for OS, that included the ATL prognostic index (PI) (ATL-PI) risk category, and non-silent mutations in seven genes, namely TP53, IRF4, RHOA, PRKCB, CARD11, CCR7, and GATA3. In the training cohort of 99 patients, the m7-ATLPI identified a low-, intermediate-, and highrisk group with 2-year OS of 100%, 43%, and 19%, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] =5.46; P<0.0001). The m7-ATLPI achieved superior risk stratification compared to the current ATL-PI (C-index 0.92 vs. 0.85, respectively). In the validation cohort of 84 patients, the m7-ATLPI defined low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups with a 2-year OS of 81%, 30%, and 0%, respectively (HR=2.33; P=0.0094), and the model again outperformed the ATL-PI (C-index 0.72 vs. 0.70, respectively). The simplified m7-ATLPI, which is easier to use in clinical practice, achieved superior risk stratification compared to the ATLPI, as did the original m7-ATLPI; the simplified version was calculated by summing the following: high-risk ATL-PI category (+10), low-risk ATL-PI category (-4), and non-silent mutations in TP53 (+4), IRF4 (+3), RHOA (+1), PRKCB (+1), CARD11 (+0.5), CCR7 (-2), and GATA3 (-3).|\n",

Detailed analysis of the clonal expansion of HTLV-1 has provided new insight into pathogenesis. Most HTLV-1-infected cells, including ATL, express CCR4 which can be targeted. Reports of antitumour effects with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation provide a rationale for novel immunotherapy approaches. Progress has been made in the indolent subtypes of ATL with the use of 'antiviral' therapies.ATL has poor prognosis. There is a major, urgent, unmet clinical need to identify HTLV carriers who will develop ATL to develop biomarkers of transforming disease and disease progression and to provide novel treatment approaches within the context of clinical trials. Several strategies now include putative or actual antiviral therapy. Potentially, the risk of ATL would be reduced by eliminating some or all infected clones.

The preponderant acute manifestation is characterized by hypercalcemia, systemic manifestations, organomegaly, and dermatological eruptions. Conversely, the chronic phenotype is typified by lymphocytosis and/or cutaneous eruptions, while smoldering ATLL assumes an asymptomatic course. Immunocompromise afflicts ATLL patients, heightening their vulnerability to opportunistic infections that frequently intricately intertwine with disease progression. Therefore, an early diagnosis is crucial to manage the disease appropriately. While conventional chemotherapeutic regimens have shown limited success, especially in acute and lymphoma types, recent studies suggest that allogeneic stem cell transplantation might enhance treatment results because it has shown promising outcomes in some patients. Novel therapeutics, such as interferon and monoclonal antibodies, have also shown promise, but more research is needed to confirm their efficacy. Moreover, the identification of biomarkers for ATLL and genetic changes in HTLV-1 infected cells has led to the development of targeted therapies that have shown remarkable success in clinical trials.

This co-option of signaling through NFÎºB provides for the HTLV-1 infected cell an escape from cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, a steady source of growth factors, and a mechanism by which the virus can activate its own target cell. Therapies that target the NFÎºB pathway sensitize adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cells to apoptosis.

ATL is clinically classified into four disease subtypes. The acute, lymphoma type, and cases of the chronic type involving unfavorable prognostic factors are regarded as aggressive ATL subtypes that require immediate treatment. Dose-intensified chemotherapy, such as the VCAP-AMP-VECP regimen, is considered to be the most recommended treatment for aggressive ATL. However, ATL remains difficult to cure and has an extremely poor prognosis, even when such chemotherapy is employed. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only known curative therapy and is recommended for younger patients with aggressive ATL. However, because of the increasing age at the onset of ATL, only a small fraction of patients with ATL can benefit from such transplants; therefore, there is an unmet medical need for novel drugs.

The majority of ATLL patients have leukemic cells with phenotype similar to Tregs, prompting suggestions that ATLL cells themselves have immunosuppressive functions. In this study, we detected CD39 expression on ATLL cells, particularly frequent on aggressive subtypes. CD39 and CD73 convert extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into adenosine, a key player in Tregs' immunosuppression. In vitro culture, both CD39+ ATLL cells and normal Tregs converted rapidly extracellular ATP to AMP, which was disturbed by CD39 inhibitors, and was negated in the CD39 knockout MJ cell line. The proliferation of cocultured CD4+/CD8+ normal T cells was suppressed by CD39+ MJ cells, but not by CD39 knockout MJ cells. Supplemented ATP was exhausted by an EG7-OVA T-cell line with stable CD39 induction, but not by mock. When these cell lines were subcutaneously transplanted into murine flanks, Poly(I:C) peritoneal administration reduced tumor size to 1/3 in mock-transplanted tumors, but not in CD39 induced tumors. Overall, we found that ATLL cells express CD39 at a high rate, and our results suggest that this helps ATLL cells escape antitumor immunity through the extracellular ATPDase-Adenosine cascade.

To determine genomic differences between these 2 cohorts, we performed targeted exon sequencing on 30 North American ATLL patients and compared the results with the Japanese ATLL cases. Although the frequency of TP53 mutations was comparable, the mutation frequency in epigenetic and histone modifying genes (57%) was significantly higher, whereas the mutation frequency in JAK/STAT and T-cell receptor/NF-ÎºB pathway genes was significantly lower. The most common type of epigenetic mutation is that affecting EP300 (20%). As a category, epigenetic mutations were associated with adverse prognosis. Dissimilarities with the Japanese cases were also revealed by RNA sequencing analysis of 9 primary patient samples. ATLL samples with a mutated EP300 gene have decreased total and acetyl p53 protein and a transcriptional signature reminiscent of p53-mutated cancers. Most importantly, decitabine has highly selective single-agent activity in the EP300-mutated ATLL samples, suggesting that decitabine treatment induces a synthetic lethal phenotype in EP300-mutated ATLL cells.

Patients with ATLL have high plasma levels of VEGF that induce angiogenesis. Prognosis of ATLL remains poor because of immunosuppression and intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy. Important advances in the treatment of ATLL were reported with the combination of zidovudine (AZT) and interferon-alpha. We investigated the effect of AZT/IFN treatment on vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) plasma levels and HTLV-I proviral load in ATLL patients from the region of Mashhad. We confirmed that AZT/IFN treatment induces a high response rate and prolonged survival with minimal side effects. We also confirmed that VEGF plasma levels and HTLV-I proviral load are higher in ATLL patients than in asymptomatic carriers.

Four clinical forms have been described (leukemic, lymphomatous, chronic, smoldering) and the phenotype corresponds to regulatory CD4+ T cells. The histological characteristics are variable, with neoplastic cells showing a size ranging from small to large and atypical nuclei with irregular contours. A series of genetic and molecular alterations have been described, which partially explain the lymphomagenesis of the neoplasm, some of which are also factors related to the clinical course and overall survival. ATLL is a neoplasm with a poor prognosis, but in recent years new targeted therapies have been designed, with encouraging responses.

We conducted RNA and targeted DNA sequencing of 8 ATLLs from Japanese patients <50 years of age and identified 3 (37.5%) with both CTLA4-CD28 and inducible costimulator (ICOS)-CD28 fusions. Mutations of PLCG1, PRKCB, and STAT3, which were frequent in other ATLL-sequencing studies, were not identified. Differential expression analysis identified the negative checkpoint molecule LAG3 as the most downregulated gene among cases with the fusions. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated expression of CD80 and CD86, the ligands for CTLA4 and CD28, on ATLL cells and tumor-associated macrophages, respectively. Expression of CTLA4-CD28 in Ba/F3 cells conferred cytokine-independent growth when cocultured with Raji cells that express CD80 and CD86. Growth was associated with recruitment of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to CTLA4-CD28 and phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. A CTLA4-blocking antibody reduced cytokine-independent growth in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these results suggest that young Japanese ATLL cases have a unique biology dependent on cell-nonautonomous interactions that drive CD28 signaling. Assessment for CD28 fusions and treatment with CTLA4 blockade should be considered in younger patients with relapsed/refractory ATLL.Â© 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.|\n",

A disease progression model from asymptomatic human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 carrier to aggressive-type ATLL has been proposed, and indolent ATLL comprising a smoldering or favorable chronic type is located at the midpoint. Even the most favorable smoldering type has a 4-year overall survival rate of <60%. Although watchful waiting is pervasive in patients with indolent ATLL, early therapeutic intervention is discussed among hematologists. Indolent ATLL was once termed T-cell-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Unlike indolent ATLL, several molecular-targeted agents at the initial treatment have dramatically improved CLL prognosis. Recent studies on CLL have revealed a similar progression model involving premalignant monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). In particular, individuals with high-count MBL have an increased lymphoma risk.

It is currently possible to select a therapeutic strategy for ATL and predict prognosis by classification of patients by clinical subtypes and clinicopathological factors. Although the overall survival (OS) of patients with ATL has increased marginally because of advances in chemotherapy, further prolongation of survival might be difficult with conventional chemotherapy alone. Promising results have been reported for antiviral therapy using zidovudine and interferon-Î±, and, indeed, antiviral therapy is currently the standard treatment for patients with ATL in western countries. Remarkably, the 5-year OS rates are 100% for both the smoldering-type and chronic-type ATL. Recently, treatments for ATL have included allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and molecular targeted therapies. Furthermore, the anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody mogamulizumab has been shown to have marked cytotoxic effects on ATL cells, especially in the leukemic type of ATL. In the lymphoma type of ATL, the response rate may be improved by combining mogamulizumab with chemotherapy.

ATLL is a rare but extremely aggressive malignancy that can be challenging to diagnose. Very little data exist on the incidence patterns of ATLL in the United States.ATLL cases reported to the National Program of Cancer Registries, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, and the New York State Cancer Registry were used for the study. Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated by age, race/ethnicity, sex, and year of diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate was compared among race/ethnicity groups with the SEER data.During 2001-2015, 2148 ATLL cases were diagnosed in the United States, 18% of which were in New York State. New York State had the highest incidence rate for ATLL, with a rising trend especially among non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs), whereas the incidence was stable across the remainder of the United States. NHBs were diagnosed at a younger median age (54Â years) and had a shorter overall survival (6Â months). In New York City, only 22.6% of the ATLL cases diagnosed were born in North America.This is the largest epidemiological study of ATLL in the United States and shows a rising incidence in New York City. NHBs have a younger age at presentation and poor overall survival. The rising incidence is largely due to NHBs originating from the Caribbean.Â© 2019 American Cancer Society.|\n",

Clinically ATLL is sub-classified into four groups: acute, lymphomatous, chronic and smoldering. ATLL is etiologically linked to the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). The diagnosis of ATLL is based upon a combination of characteristic clinical manifestations, morphological and immunophenotypic changes of the malignant cells, in addition to the confirmation of HTLV-I infection. ATLL is an aggressive malignancy with a median survival of less than 12 months and no successful treatment yet available. Patients are either refractory or only transiently respond to chemotherapy or purine analogues. Smoldering and chronic ATLL pursue an indolent course and survival for years until the disease progresses and becomes refractory to therapy. The major causes of death in ATLL are opportunistic pulmonary infections and progressive disease, often in association with hypercalcemia.|\n",

Acute, lymphoma, and unfavorable chronic type ATL and favorable chronic and smoldering-type ATL are defined as aggressive and indolent ATL, respectively. Newly identified prognostic indices based on clinical parameters and/or genetic predictors should be incorporated in the stratified treatment approach. The standard of care for aggressive ATL is multiagent chemotherapy, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation if applicable. Meanwhile, that for indolent ATL is watchful waiting until progression to the aggressive type. The combination of interferon-Î± and zidovudine is a treatment option for indolent ATL in other countries, and a confirmatory phase 3 trial is ongoing in Japan. In addition to mogamulizumab, lenalidomide, and brentuximab vedotin, which have been recently utilized in clinical practice, the use of a novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor has been filed for approval.

Expert commentary: Mogamulizumab has shown significant efficacy in treating ATL with moderately high response rates and has been approved in Japan for use in ATL. It may serve as a bridge therapy to achieve disease control prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It also offers potential for use in combination with conventional chemotherapy.

Successful treatment is limited by resistance to chemotherapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel effective strategies. Artesunate (ART), a widely used antimalarial compound, has been shown to exert cytotoxicity. Here, we aimed to assess the anti-ATLL activities of ART and to elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms involved in this effect. Compared with uninfected T cells, HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines were sensitive to ART-induced cytotoxicity. ART caused cell cycle arrest at G1 and/or G2/M phases, which was associated with decreased expression of cyclin dependent kinase 1/2/4/6, cyclin B1/D2/E and c-Myc, and increased expression of p21. ART-induced apoptosis corresponded to activation of caspase-8/9/3; decreased expression of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, myeloid cell leukemia-1, survivin, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1/2; and increased expression of Bak. ART increased intracellular reactive oxygen species and activation of the DNA damage marker Î³-H2AX. Moreover, ART-induced cytotoxicity was partly reversed by treatment with a reactive oxygen species scavenger, iron chelator, and necroptosis or ferroptosis inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of caspase-dependent and -independent lethal pathways. These effects were correlated with inhibition of nuclear factor-ÎºB and activator protein-1 signaling through dephosphorylation of IÎºBÎ±, IÎºB kinase (IKK) Î± and IKKÎ², and decreased expression of JunB and JunD. Importantly, intraperitoneal injection with ART lowered tumor burden in an ATLL murine model.

The disease manifests with leukaemia in greater than two thirds of patients, while the remaining patients have a lymphomatous form. According to the disease manifestations, various forms which differ in clinical course and prognosis have been recognised: acute, chronic, smouldering and lymphoma. Organomegaly, skin involvement, circulating atypical lymphocytes (\"flower\" cells) with a CD4+ CD25+ phenotype and hypercalcaemia are the most common disease features. The diagnosis should be based on a constellation of clinical features and laboratory investigations. The latter comprise: lymphocyte morphology, immunophenotype, histology of the tissues affected in the pure lymphoma forms and serology or DNA analysis for HTLV-I. The differential diagnosis of ATLL includes other mature T-cell neoplasms such as T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), SÃ©zary syndrome (SS), peripheral T-cell lymphomas and occasionally healthy carriers of the virus or Hodgkin disease.

To evaluate the effect of CBT against ATLL, we retrospectively analyzed data from 175 patients with ATLL who initially underwent single-unit CBT. The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate was 20.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.8% to 27.4%). A multivariate analysis revealed that the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was a favorable prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio, .10; 95% CI, .01 to .94; PÂ =Â .044). Furthermore, the 2-year OS (42.7%; 95% CI, 28.1% to 56.6%) of patients with grade 1 to 2 acute GVHD was higher than that of patients without acute GVHD (24.2%; 95% CI, 11.2% to 39.8%; PÂ =Â .048). However, the cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) was high (46.1%; 95% CI, 38.2% to 53.7%), and early death was particularly problematic. In conclusion, CBT cures patients with ATLL partly through a graft-versus-ATLL effect. However, novel interventions will be required, particularly in the early phase, to reduce TRM and optimize GVHD.Copyright Â© 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

      "|  GVL for ATL? |10.1182/blood.2019002038|  18042693 |Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a malignancy of mature CD4+ T-cells caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Twenty million people are believed to be infected throughout the world, mostly in Japan, Africa, the Caribbean, and South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru. ATL affects about 5% of infected individuals and is classified in the following clinical forms: acute, lymphoma, primary cutaneous tumoral, chronic (favorable and unfavorable), and smoldering (leukemic and non-leukemic). Although it is considered an aggressive disease, there are cases with a long progression. We emphasize the importance of clinical classification as an indispensable element for evaluating prognosis and appropriate therapeutic approach. Since several cases have been published in Brazil and this disease is still poorly known, we decided to make a review paper for dissemination of clinical, hematological and pathological aspects, diagnosis, and therapy. The best way to reduce the occurrence of ATL would be halting the transmission of the virus through breastfeeding.|\n",

Available therapies for ATLL have minimal efficacy, with few responders and poor survival. New therapies are needed for ATLL patients. Three decades of research in this field has resulted in accumulation of a wealth of knowledge about the molecular pathways underlying the proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T cells. Inappropriate over- and under-activation of various signaling pathways can contribute to pathological processes such as neoplasia. Molecular and pharmacological interventions that target the aberrant state of activation are thus of potential therapeutic benefit. Here we review how signal transduction pathway components including nuclear factor-kappaB, activator protein-1, janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt contribute to the pathogenesis of ATLL. The targeted inhibition of such molecules to suppress the growth of HTLV-1-infected T cells both in vitro and in vivo is also discussed. The potential translation of such strategies into effective therapies for patients with ATLL may improve the poor outcome associated with this neoplasia.|\n",

      "|Lenalidomide treatment for recurrent adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.|10.3816/CLML.2010.n.084|  34248128 |Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a malignancy of mature T cells associated with chronic infection by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1). ATLL patients with aggressive subtypes have dismal outcomes. We demonstrate that ATLL cells co-opt an early checkpoint within the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) pathway, resulting in survival advantage. This early checkpoint revolves around an interaction between the deubiquitinase CYLD and its target RIPK1. The status of RIPK1 K63-ubiquitination determines cell fate by creating either a prosurvival signal (ubiquitinated RIPK1) or a death signal (deubiquitinated RIPK1). In primary ATLL samples and in cell line models, an increased baseline level of CYLD phosphorylation was observed. We therefore tested the hypothesis that this modification of CYLD, which has been reported to inhibit its deubiquitinating function, leads to increased RIPK1 ubiquitination and thus provides a prosurvival signal to ATLL cells. CYLD phosphorylation can be pharmacologically reversed by IKK inhibitors, specifically by TBK1/IKKÎµ and IKKÎ² inhibitors (MRT67307 and TPCA). Both of the IKK sub-families can phosphorylate CYLD, and the combination of MRT67307 and TPCA have a marked effect in reducing CYLD phosphorylation and triggering cell death. ATLL cells overexpressing a kinase-inactive TBK1 (TBK1-K38A) demonstrate lower CYLD phosphorylation and subsequently reduced proliferation. IKK blockade reactivates CYLD, as evidenced by the reduction in RIPK1 ubiquitination, which leads to the association of RIPK1 with the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) to trigger cell death. In the absence of CYLD, RIPK1 ubiquitination remains elevated following IKK blockade and it does not associate with the DISC. SMAC mimetics can similarly disrupt CYLD phosphorylation and lead to ATLL cell death through reduction of RIPK1 ubiquitination, which is CYLD dependent. These results identify CYLD as a crucial regulator of ATLL survival and point to its role as a potential novel target for pharmacologic modification in this disease.|\n",

HTLV-1 infects 15 to 20 million individuals worldwide. This oncoretrovirus can be transmitted in three ways: horizontally (sexually), vertically (mother to child), and via blood transfusion. HTLV-1 causes two major diseases: adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). ATLL can be classified into four major subtypes: a smoldering type, a chronic type, a lymphoma type, and a leukemic type. Because of intrinsic chemoresistance and severe immunosuppression, the survival rate of ATLL patients, especially those who develop the acute leukemic or lymphoma forms, is very poor, and such clonal malignant CD4 expansion remains one of the most severe lymphoproliferations. This article discusses a number of recent treatments including antiretroviral therapy, aggressive chemotherapy, and allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation, as well as new drugs.|\n",

However, in a recent report, we demonstrated that the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab led to rapid progression in patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) (NCT02631746). We obtained primary cells from these patients to determine the cause of this hyperprogression. Analyses of clonality, somatic mutations, and gene expression in the malignant cells confirmed the report of rapid clonal expansion after PD-1 blockade in these patients, revealed a previously unappreciated origin of these malignant cells, identified a novel connection between ATLL cells and tumor-resident regulatory T cells (Tregs), and exposed a tumor-suppressive role for PD-1 in ATLL. Identifying the mechanisms driving this alarming outcome in nivolumab-treated ATLL may be broadly informative for the growing problem of rapid progression with immune checkpoint therapies.|\n",

Clinically, ATL is classified into four subtypes: acute, lymphoma, chronic and smoldering type. Although the prognosis of chronic and smoldering-type ATL is relatively good, that of patients with acute- or lymphoma-type ATL still remains extremely poor. Zidovudine/IFN-Î± therapy seems to be promising, although its efficacy has not yet been confirmed in well-designed prospective studies. High-dose chemotherapy with the support of autologous transplantation does not improve outcome. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is promising and approximately 40% of aggressive ATL patients are expected to survive long-term, although transplantation-related mortality is as high as 40-50%. Stem cell transplantation using reduced-intensity conditioning is also effective and safer, with graft-versus-ATL and graft-versus-human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I effects observed after transplantation. Novel approaches including new agents such as purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors, or targeted immunotherapy using antichemokine receptor-4 antibody or dendritic cell/peptide vaccine are also warranted.|\n",

CADM1/TSLC1 expression is reduced in a variety of cancers via promoter methylation, and this reduction is associated with poor prognosis and enhanced metastatic potential. In contrast, we observed that CADM1/TSLC1 is highly and ectopically expressed in all primary adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cells and in most human T-cell leukemia virus type (HTLV)-1-infected T-cell and ATLL cell lines. No expression, however, was detected in CD4+ T cells or in several other non-HTLV-1-infected leukemia cells. Moreover, we identified that high CADM1/TSLC1 expression plays an important role in enhanced cell-cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium, tumor growth and the ability of ATLL cells to infiltrate organs. We developed various antibodies as diagnostic tools to identify CADM1+ ATLL cells. Using flow cytometry, we determined that CADM1/TSLC1 is present on the surface of ATLL cells. The percentage of CD4+CADM1+ cells in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1 carriers and ATLL patients was highly correlated with the DNA copy number of HTLV-1 in lymphocytes. In particular, we identified the soluble form of CADM1/TSLC1 in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1 carriers and ATLL patients. Therefore, measurements of soluble CADM1/TSLC1 serum levels and the detection of CD4+CADM1+ cells in the blood, when combined with standard diagnostic methods, would be useful for identifying and monitoring disease progression in HTLV-1 carriers. Such tests would provide increased accuracy and may aid in early diagnosis and in determining the effects of ATLL treatments.|\n",

Historically, the chemotherapy regimen CHOP (cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone) has been the standard treatment of this rare malignancy. However, its prognosis is poor and median survival in the aggressive variants of ATLL is only 6-10 months. Recently, a more aggressive regimen piloted in Japan, vincristine/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/prednisone (VCAP)- doxorubicin/ranimustine/prednisone (AMP)- vindesine/etoposide/carboplatin/prednisone (VECP), has been reported to yield better survival results over biweekly CHOP in a phase III trial. However, the hyper- cyclophosphamide/vincristine/doxorubicin/dexamethasone (CVAD) regimen is a much more frequently used regimen for the treatment of aggressive hematologic malignancies, and has a higher intensity then CHOP. Yet, there is little reported experience with hyper-CVAD regimen in ATLL.We present 2 patients diagnosed with ATLL who were treated with hyper-CVAD chemotherapy and have achieved a durable complete remission. One of the patients has gone on to receive an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and has been in complete remission for over 18 months. The other has been in a continuous remission for approximately 12 months. We also review the past published experience with the hyper-CVAD regimen in patients with ATLL.A commonly used chemotherapy regimen for aggressive hematologic malignancies, hyper-CVAD, can induce durable remissions in patients with ATLL.|\n",

This report documents a prospective feasibility study of alloSCT with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIST) for elderly ATLL patients (>50 years). Regimen-related toxicities and nonhematologic toxicities were acceptable. Fourteen of 15 evaluable patients achieved complete donor chimerism within 90 days, and 1 patient had early TRM after RIST. The HTLV-1 proviral load became undetectable in 8 of 15 patients, suggesting that RIST has potential as an antiviral treatment. The results of alloSCT are promising, and 30% to 40% of patients who achieve remission and have suitable donors can now become long-term survivors with either conventional alloSCT or RIST.

In this case, it can be useful to identify common mutational overlap among subsets of rare leukemias to increase the number of individuals that may benefit from a targeted therapy. This chapter examines the current mutational landscape of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia with a focus on STAT3 mutations, the most common mutation in LGL leukemia to date. We examined the linkage between these mutations and autoimmune symptoms and disorders, in cases of obvious and suspected LGL leukemia. We then summarized and compared mutations in a set of other rare leukemias that also have JAK/STAT signaling pathway activation brought about by genomic changes. These include T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), select peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL).

Although the viral transactivating protein Tax has been proposed to play a critical role in leukemogeneis as shown by its transforming activity in various experimental systems, additional cellular events are required for the development of ATLL. One of the genetic events in ATLL is inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Among many candidates for tumor suppressor genes, the main genetic events have been reported to center around the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors ((CDKIs) p15INK4A, p16INK4B, p18INK4C, p19INK4D, p21WAF1, p27KIP1, and p57KIP2), p53 and Rb genes; all of them play a major regulatory role during G1 to S transition in the cell cycle. Acute/lymphomatous ATLL has frequent alterations of p15 (20%) and p16 (28-67%), while chronic/smoldering ATLL has fewer abnormalities of p15 (0-13%) and p16 (5-26%). Most of these changes are deletion of the genes; fewer samples have mutations. ATLL patients with deleted p15 and/or p16 genes have significantly shorter survival than those individuals with both genes preserved. Although genetic alterations of p18, p19, p21, p27 have rarely been reported, inactivation of these genes may contribute to the development of ATLL because low expression levels of these genes seem to mark ATLL. The p53 gene is mutated in 10-50% of acute/lymphomatous ATLL. Functional impairment of the p53 protein, even if the gene has wild-type sequences, has been suggested in HTLV-I infected cells. Each of these genetic events are mainly found in acute/lymphomatous ATLL, suggesting that alterations of these genes may be associated with transformation to an aggressive phenotype. The Rb tumor suppressor gene is infrequently structurally altered, but one half of ATLL cases have lost expression of this key protein. Notably, alterations of one of the CDKIs, p53 and Rb genes appear to obviate the need for inactivation of other genes in the same pathway. A novel tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 6q may also have a critical role in the pathogenesis of ATLL. Taken together, tumor suppressor genes are frequently altered in acute/lymphomatous ATLL and their alteration is probably the driving force fueling the transition from chronic/smoldering to acute/lymphomatous ATLL.|\n",

The vaccination protocol was completed with three injections at a 2-week interval, within one month. Good quality of life and long-term treatment-free survival were observed for more than 3 years in two of the three patients enrolled in the pilot study. Furthermore, the proviral load remained mostly around the carrier level, with minor fluctuation, after vaccination. Tax-specific proliferative CTL responses were observed in all cases and sporadically augmented responses were also subsequently detected. The Tax-DC vaccine might be a well-tolerated and long-lasting maintenance therapy that is acceptable even for elderly patients.

The diversity in clinical features and prognosis of patients with this disease has led to its subclassification into the following four categories: acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The chronic and smoldering subtypes are considered indolent and are usually managed with watchful waiting until disease progression, analogous to the management of some patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or other indolent histology lymphomas. Patients with aggressive ATL generally have a poor prognosis because of multidrug resistance of malignant cells, a large tumor burden with multiorgan failure, hypercalcemia, and/or frequent infectious complications as a result of a profound T-cell immunodeficiency. Under the sponsorship of the 13th International Conference on Human Retrovirology: HTLV, a group of ATL researchers joined to form a consensus statement based on established data to define prognostic factors, clinical subclassifications, and treatment strategies. A set of response criteria specific for ATL reflecting a combination of those for lymphoma and CLL was proposed. Clinical subclassification is useful but is limited because of the diverse prognosis among each subtype. Molecular abnormalities within the host genome, such as tumor suppressor genes, may account for these diversities. A treatment strategy based on the clinical subclassification and prognostic factors is suggested, including watchful waiting approach, chemotherapy, antiviral therapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (alloHSCT), and targeted therapies.|\n",

ATL occurs in only 2% to 4% of HTLV-I-infected people [1-3]. When it does occur, it is usually aggressive and difficult to treat; most people survive for less than 1 year [1-3]. Combination chemotherapy with cytotoxic agents has yielded complete response rates of 20% to 45%, but responses usually last only a few months [3]. Recently, novel treatments, such as monoclonal antibodies directed at the interleukin-2 receptor and the combination of interferon alfa and zidovudine, have been shown to be active in the treatment of patients with ATL. A small percentage of patients achieve long-lasting remissions [2,3].|\n",

However, bowel perforation in ATLL patients is rare. Herein, we present a case of ATLL with bowel perforation. A 75-year-old man presented with bowel distension. Computed tomography showed a large mass of the cecum. Edema and stenosis of the ascending colon was seen on colonoscopy, and tumor on the anal side of the stenosis was also found. After admission, the patient complained of abdominal pain with a peritoneal irritation sign. Free air was seen around a large mass of the cecum on computed tomography and an emergency operation was performed under the diagnosis of bowel perforation. Microscopic examination revealed bowel infiltration of ATLL. Gastrointestinal perforation can be caused by ATLL itself and is associated with a poor prognosis. The standard treatment for ATLL is chemotherapy but emergency surgery is necessary in case of perforation. It is important to observe the patient with ATLL carefully.|\n",

The first human retrovirus HTLV-I (human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I) is considered to be related to its aetiology. In ATL endemic areas, HTLV-I carriers form a fairly high percentage of the population, even among healthy individuals. ATL shows diverse clinical features. It can be divided into four subtypes: acute, chronic, smouldering and lymphoma type. ATL cells originate from the CD4-positive subset of peripheral T cells; they show a characteristic notch in the nucleus and a tendency to lobulation. ATL resists chemotherapy, and patients with acute and lymphoma types have a fairly poor prognosis. A definite diagnosis of ATL is made by documenting the presence of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the DNA of tumour cells. HTLV-I infection is caused by transmission of live lymphocytes via three routes (from mother to child, from males to females, and by transfusion). Familial occurrence of ATL is frequently seen. HTLV-I infection is seen in other countries, but its incidence is highest in Japan. Infection with HTLV-I is a direct cause of ATL. Furthermore, infection with this virus can indirectly cause many other diseases via the induction of immunodeficiency, such as chronic lung disease, opportunistic lung infection, cancer of other organs, monoclonal gammopathy, chronic renal failure, strongyloidiasis, non-specific dermatomycosis, HTLV-I-associated lymphadenitis, HTLV-I uveitis and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy-tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).|\n",

Patients with ATLL frequently develop humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) resulting from increased osteoclastic bone resorption. Our goal was to investigate the mechanisms of ATLL-induced osteoclastic bone resorption. Murine calvaria co-cultured with HTLV-1-infected cells directly or conditioned media from cell cultures had increased osteoclast activity that was dependent on RANKL, indicating that factors secreted from ATLL cells had a stimulatory effect on bone resorption. Factors released from resorbing bone stimulated proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), both osteoclast stimulators, were expressed in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Interestingly, when HTLV-1-infected T-cells were co-cultured with pre-osteoblasts, the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG), an osteoclast inhibitory factor, was significantly down-regulated in the pre-osteoblasts. When OPG was added into the ex vivo osteoclastogenesis assay induced by HTLV-1-infected T-cells, osteoclastogenesis was strongly inhibited. In addition, HTLV-1-infected T-cells inhibited expression of early osteoblast genes and induced late genes. These regulators will serve as future therapeutic targets for the treatments of HHM in ATLL.|\n",

Small ordinary looking lymphocytes with round nuclei were detected in the background of six patients with HTLV-1+ HL, which were immunohistochemically negative for CD25 and CC chemokine receptor (CCR)4 and had a low MIB1 labeling index (mean: 28.3%). In the HL-like ATLL specimens, small- and medium-sized atypical lymphocytes with indented and irregular-shaped nuclei were found, and were diffusely positive for CD25 and CCR4, with high MIB1 labeling (mean: 76%). Both groups had scattered CD30+ and CD15+ Hodgkin and Reed Sternberg (RS) giant cells, with or without CD20 expression and Epstein-Barr virus infection. The 50% overall survival period was significantly longer for the HTLV-1+ HL group (180Â months) than for the HL-like ATLL group (7.8Â months; PÂ =Â .004).HTLV-1+ HL showed typical small lymphoid cells with a low MIB1 labeling index in a background of Hodgkin and RS cells, with some scattered CD25+ and CCR4+ lymphocytes. In HTLV-1 endemic areas, distinguishing HTLV-1+ HL from HL-like ATLL is important because of their differing treatment strategies and prognoses.Â© 2020 The Authors.

Intensive combination chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been introduced since the previous Japanese nationwide survey was performed in the late 1980s. In this study, we delineated the current features and management of ATL in Japan. The clinical data were collected retrospectively from the medical records of patients diagnosed with ATL between 2000 and 2009, and a total of 1665 patients' records were submitted to the central office from 84 institutions in Japan. Seventy-one patients were excluded; 895, 355, 187, and 157 patients with acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types, respectively, remained. The median survival times were 8.3, 10.6, 31.5, and 55.0 months, and 4-year overall survival (OS) rates were 11%, 16%, 36%, and 52%, respectively, for acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The number of patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 227, and their median survival time and OS at 4 years after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 5.9 months and 26%, respectively. This study revealed that the prognoses of the patients with acute and lymphoma types were still unsatisfactory, despite the recent progress in treatment modalities, but an improvement of 4-year OS was observed in comparison with the previous survey. Of note, one-quarter of patients who could undergo transplantation experienced long survival. It is also noted that the prognosis of the smoldering type was worse than expected.Â© 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.|\n",

Ten years of work on HTLV-1-associated diseases in an endemic region of Iran have been critically compared in the present study. The outstanding findings of RNA-seq, system biology analysis, and gene expression measurements on adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and enzootic bovine leukosis(EBL) in our lab encouraged us to investigate the significant role of oncogenes in the ATLL malignancy. Most studies assessed such interactions by the proviral load (PVL), Tax, and HBZ regulatory proteins in HTLV-1 and the host's immunological and cell cycle factors. The current study is a comprehensive comparing view of our previously published and unpublished results investigating the HTLV-1-host interactions leading to the transformation of the infected cell. The main focus has been on the essential proteins implicated in the virus dissemination, cell survival, and proliferation of infected cells toward leukemia development and progression. Similar to its homolog BLV-AS-1-2 in EBL, the HTLV-1-HBZ is a pivotal factor in the maintenance and progression of the ATLL. In addition, the inappropriate activities of the PI3K/Akt pathway, BRCAs, and RAD51 in the DNA repair system, which are orchestrating many other immortalization pathways, might be the central factors in the manifestation of ATLL. HTLV-1-HBZ and the host PI3K/Akt pathway, BCAs, and RAD51 could be suggested as influential targets for the prognosis and proper therapy of ATLL.Copyright Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Although the process of clonal evolution of ATL cells may involve multiple steps, ATL cells from half of the ATL cases still retain the ability to express HTLV-I Tax, a key molecule of HTLV-I leukemogenesis. A recent finding of reactivation of Tax-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in ATL patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation suggests the presence of Tax expression in vivo and potential contribution of the CTL to antitumor immunity. This is consistent with the results of a series of animal experiments indicating that Tax-specific CTL limit the growth of HTLV-I-infected cells in vivo, although the animal model mimics only an early phase of HTLV-I infection and leukemogenesis. Establishment of an insufficient HTLV-I-specific T-cell response and an increased viral load in orally HTLV-I-infected rats suggests that host HTLV-I-specific T-cell response at a primary HTLV-I infection can be a critical determinant of persistent HTLV-I levels thereafter. These findings indicate that Tax-targeted vaccines may be effective for prophylaxis of ATL in a high-risk group, and also for therapy of ATL in at least half the cases.|\n",

Although conjunctival lymphoma is commonly reported with B-cell lymphoma, it rarely occurs in cases of ATLL. A 73-year-old Japanese female patient was admitted to our institution with evidence of abnormal lymphocytes, lymphadenopathy, and lung nodular lesions. Acute type ATLL was diagnosed, and therapy following the mLSG15 protocol was initiated. At the end of the second course, new bone lesions were detected. A modified treatment regimen was scheduled, but was postponed due to the appearance of gastrointestinal symptoms. Close observation resulted in a diagnosis of cytomegalovirus enteritis. One month after the diagnosis, the patient developed pain and discomfort in her left eye, which was determined to be due to a bulbar conjunctival tumor. Pathological findings revealed conjunctival infiltration of ATLL. Mogamulizumab treatment was initiated and was successful in eradicating the conjunctival lesions after the first course. However, at the end of the third course of therapy, pancytopenia was noted. Therefore, mogamulizumab therapy was discontinued, and the patient was on follow-up observation. Although there was no relapse of the conjunctival lesions, the patient died 1 year after the initial diagnosis, following therapy resistance.|\n",

YG-PLL originates from lymphoma cells and contains a defective HTLV-I proviral genome. Although YG-PLL cannot survive without IL-2/4, the follicular dendritic cell (FDC)-like cell line HK expressing OX40-ligand gene (OX40L+HK) inhibited their death in the presence of soluble neutral polymers. After the prevention of cell death, YG-PLL proliferated on OX40L+HK without IL2/4 in the presence of two kinds of positively or negatively charged polymers. In particular, dermatan sulfate and poly-L-histidine supported growth for more than 4 months. Therefore, the original lymphoma cells proliferated transiently in the presence of IL2/4, and their growth arrest was inhibited by the addition of PLL. Furthermore, YG-PLL lost IL2/4 dependency by the following 3-step procedure: preculture with IL2/4 and neutral polymers, 3-day culture with neutral polymer on OX40L+HK to inhibit cell death, and co-culture with OX40L+HK in the presence of the positively and negatively charged polymers. The extracellular environment made by soluble polymers plays a role in the growth of ATLL in vitro.|\n",

In a quest for new therapeutic targets, our study sought to determine the levels of AKT, mTOR, and PI3K in ATLL MT-2 cells, HTLV-1 infected NIH/3T3 cells (Inf-3T3), and HTLV-1 infected patients (Carrier, HAM/TSP, and ATLL). Furthermore, the effects of rigosertib, wortmannin, and rapamycin on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to inhibit the proliferation of ATLL cells were examined. The results showed that mRNA expression of Akt/PI3K/mTOR was down-regulated in carrier, HAM/TSP, and ATLL patients, as well as MT-2, and Inf-3T3 cells, compared to the healthy individuals and untreated MT-2 and Inf-3T3 as controls. However, western blotting revealed an increase in the phosphorylated and activated forms of AKT and mTOR. Treating the cells with rapamycin, wortmannin, and rigosertib decreased the phosphorylated forms of Akt and mTOR and restored their mRNA expression levels. Using these inhibitors also significantly boosted the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as well as the expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in the MT-2 and Inf-3T3cells. Rigosertib was more potent than wortmannin and rapamycin in inducing sub-G1 and G2-M cell cycle arrest, as well as late apoptosis in the Inf-3T3 and MT-2 cells. It also synergized the cytotoxic effects of vincristine. These findings demonstrate that HTLV-1 downregulation of the mRNA level may occur as a negative feedback response to increased PI3K-Akt-mTOR phosphorylation by HTLV-1. Therefore, using rigosertib alone or in combination with common chemotherapy drugs may be beneficial in ATLL patients.Â© 2023 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.|\n",

However, in primary ATL cells, although expression of the virus, including the Tax oncoprotein, appears just after an in vitro culture, integration sites of the provirus into the host genome are random, and chromosomal/genetic abnormalities are complex. ATL is thus a single disease entity that is caused by HTLV-1 and possesses diverse molecular features. The clinical features and prognosis of ATL vary, and this has led to subtypes classified into four categories: acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering types, based on lactate dehydrogenase and calcium values and organ involvement. Approximately 15 to 20 million individuals are infected with HTLV-1 worldwide, 1.1 million of whom reside in Japan, and the annual incidence of ATL has been estimated to be approximately 1,000. HTLV-1 infection early in life, mainly from breast feeding, is crucial for the development of ATL. The age-specific occurrence of ATL and complex genome abnormalities that accumulate with disease progression suggest a multistep carcinogenesis model following HTLV-1 infection. Various treatment options are available for ATL and consist of watchful waiting for indolent ATL, intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for aggressive ATL, and a combination of IFNÎ± and zidovudine for ATL with leukemic manifestation. Several promising new agents, including an anti-CCR4 antibody, are currently undergoing clinical trials associated with translational research.

Although progress has been made to understand the disease, survival outcomes with current standard therapy remain extremely poor particularly in acute ATLL, underlying the need for better understanding of its biology and identification of novel therapeutic targets. Recently, it was demonstrated that ATLL of North American-descendent patients (NA-ATLL) is both clinically and molecularly distinct from Japanese-descendent (J-ATLL), with inferior prognosis and higher incidence of epigenetic-targeting mutations compared with J-ATLL. In this study, combined chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic profiling were used to further understand the key transcriptional regulators of NA-ATLL compared with J-ATLL. The ETS1 motif was found to be enriched in chromatin regions that were differentially open in NA-ATLL, whereas the AP1/IRF4 motifs were enriched in chromatin regions more open in J-ATLL. ETS1 expression was markedly elevated in NA-ATLL in both cell line and primary tumor samples, and knockdown of ETS1 in NA-ATLL cells resulted in inhibition of cell growth. CCR4, a previously identified oncogenic factor in ATLL, was found to be a direct ETS1 transcriptional target in NA-ATLL. As such, ETS1 provides an alternate mechanism to enhance CCR4 expression/activity in NA-ATLL, even in the absence of activating CCR4 mutations (CCR4 mutations were identified in 4 of 9 NA-ATLL cases). Taken together, this study identifies ETS1 as a novel dominant oncogenic transcriptional regulator in NA-ATLL.Â© 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

A high viral burden (proviral load) is associated with both the inflammatory and malignant diseases caused by HTLV-1, and it has been believed that the oligoclonal expansion of infected cells predisposes to these diseases. However, it is not understood what regulates the clonality of HTLV-1 in vivo, that is, the number and abundance of HTLV-1-infected T cell clones.

Despite the recent advances in chemotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT), and supportive care, the prognosis for patients with ATL is one of the poorest among hematological malignancies; overall survival (OS) at 3 years is only 24 % in the more aggressive subtypes of ATLL. HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus infecting approximately 10-20 million people worldwide, particularly in southern and southeastern Japan, the Caribbean, highlands of South America, Melanesia, and Equatorial Africa. Despite this high frequency of human infection, only 2-5 % of HTLV-1-infected individuals develop ATLL. Three major routes of viral transmission have been established: (1) mother-to-child transmission through breast-feeding; (2) sexual transmission, predominantly from men to women; and (3) cellular blood components. Multiple factors (e.g., virus, host cell, and immune factors) have been implicated in the development of ATLL, although the underlying mechanisms of leukemogenesis have not been fully elucidated. No preventive vaccine against HTLV-1 is currently available, and interrupting the well-recognized primary modes of HTLV-1 transmission is the mainstay of ATLL prevention. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission through the replacement of breast-feeding has been shown to have the most significant impact on the incidence of HTLV-1 infection, and public health policies should consider the risk of malnutrition, especially in developing countries where malnutrition is the significant cause of infant mortality.|\n",

Major concerns exist about the possible adverse effects of pretransplantation Mog because Mog depletes regulatory T cells for several months. We assessed the impact of pretransplantation Mog on clinical outcomes after allo-HSCT.We included 996 allo-HSCT recipients age 70 years or younger with aggressive ATLL who were given the diagnosis between 2000 and 2013 and who received intensive chemotherapy by multiple chemotherapeutic drugs as first-line therapy. Before allo-HSCT, 82 patients received Mog with a median interval of 45 days from the last Mog to allo-HSCT.Pretransplantation Mog was associated with an increased risk of grade 3 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; relative risk, 1.80; P < .01) and refractoriness to systemic corticosteroid for acute GVHD (relative risk, 2.09; P < .01). One-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was significantly higher in patients with pretransplantation Mog compared with those without (43.7% v 25.1%; P < .01). The probability of 1-year overall survival was also significantly inferior in patients with pretransplantation Mog compared with those without (32.3% v 49.4%; P < .01). In particular, use of Mog with intervals < 50 days to allo-HSCT was associated with a dismal clinical outcome.Pretransplantation Mog was significantly associated with an increased risk of GVHD-related mortality, which supports the relevance of CCR4-expressing Tregs after allo-HSCT in humans.

      "|Tumor immunity against adult T-cell leukemia.|10.1016/j.carpath.2022.107513|  29394679 |Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a rare disease with a unique geographic distribution. Conducting controlled randomized trials to assess the effective therapeutic strategies has therefore been a significant challenge to date.This review explores the natural history and diagnostic evaluation of ATL, followed by a focused review of existing studies on the most potent individual pharmaceutical agents and combinations used in the therapy of this malignancy. Readers will acquire considerable insights about the clinical subsets, diagnosis and the most effective therapies used in various ATL types.International, multicenter, randomized clinical trials are essential to design optimal therapeutic strategies for various ATL subsets. It appears that patients with acute ATL type benefit considerably from the first-line combined antiviral therapy with zidovudine and interferon alpha, whereas patients with ATL of the lymphoma type may experience a better outcome with intensive chemotherapy. The role of therapy in smoldering and chronic disease types remains to be clarified. In addition, the results of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation in ATL appear promising, as up to 40% of patients who achieve remission and have suitable donors can now become long-term survivors. Prospective evaluation of novel effective agents and their incorporation into various therapeutic algorithms is stringently needed.|\n",

Case report and literature review.|10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.02.039|  8038496  |Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive HTLV-1-related malignancy, rare outside of regions where the retrovirus is endemic. Although the use of antiviral therapy has improved outcomes, particularly for indolent forms of ATL, response to combination chemotherapy is poor and outcomes for aggressive subtypes remains dismal. Consolidation with allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) has an increasing role in the management of ATL in eligible patients, offering favourable long-term remission rates. However, relatively high-transplant-related mortality and issues with donor recruitment for certain ethnicities remain problematic. In this review, we discuss the rationale for and issues surrounding alloSCT in ATL in the context of conventional and emerging therapies.|\n",

Despite its poor prognosis, there is no standard therapy for ATLL due to its low incidence and the disease affecting only endemic geographical clusters.A retrospective evaluation of patients with the diagnosis of ATLL at Moffitt Cancer Center and Memorial Healthcare System was done to identify patients and disease characteristics along with the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the different therapies used.The 61 patients analyzed showed a median age of 58 with 82.5% of them being of African American descent. The acute variant contributed to the majority of cases (43.9%), followed by 36.8% presenting as a lymphoma variant. There was no statistical difference in the PFS (6.4 m, 3.1 m, 2.1 m; p = 0.23) or OS (14 m, 8.9 m, 18.5 m; p = 0.14) between cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), intensive chemotherapy regimens, and other modalities, respectively. However, the patients who had complete or partial remission with first-line therapy had better OS (15.9 m vs. 7.2 m; p = 0.004).The study highlighted the poor outcome of the current regimens and the lack of a unifying protocol for this vicious disease. The acute variants were treated with more intensive regimens, but there was no difference in the OS between the three major options of CHOP, intensified chemotherapy, and others. This underscores the need for more clinical trials to develop better outcomes.Â© 2023 S. Karger AG, Basel.|\n",

A new anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 monoclonal antibody (mogamulizumab) has been shown to be effective for ATLL. Although mogamulizumab is now available in Japan for patients with ATLL, the influence on allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains unclear. Here we report a woman with ATLL resistant to combination chemotherapy, who achieved complete remission following treatment with mogamulizumab and subsequently received allogeneic HSCT. The patient has remained in complete remission with controlled graft-versus-host disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an ATLL patient who received mogamulizumab treatment followed by allogeneic HSCT. We suggest that administration of mogamulizumab to chemotherapy-resistant patients with ATLL may improve their disease status before allogeneic HSCT and result in better survival.|\n",

A population of 10 to 20 million worldwide is estimated to be infected by the virus, but only 1-4% develop ATLL during a 70-year lifespan. The latency period is more than 30 years. The aim of this study was to report two cases of ATLL in Greek patients with the concomitant study of their family members. A 55-year-old woman and a 59-year-old man presented with leucocytosis and lymphocytosis. Both were asymptomatic and physical examination was unremarkable except for minimal lymphadenopathy in the second patient. In both patients blood smears showed small-to-medium-sized, multilobulated lymphocytes, with different degrees of nuclear irregularity. Immunophenotypic study was as follows: CD2 + (97%), CD3 + (95%), CD5 + (95%), CD3/CD4 + (93%), CD3/CD25 + (84%), CD7 -/CD4 + (89%) CD2 + /HLA-DR + (53%), TCRabeta + (96%) and CD7-(7%). Bone marrow biopsy revealed a normal cellularity with dyserythropoiesis and scattered small lymphocytes (CD4 + on immunostaining) Serum HTLV I and II antibodies were positive. T-cell receptor gamma-chain rearrangement was positive in blood lymphocytes by PCR. Cytogenetic analysis showed complex karyotypic abnormalities. DNA analysis by PCR demonstrated the integration of the HTLV-I DNA in the DNA of the neoplastic T cells. Both patients rapidly developed acute type ATLL. In the first patient multiple subcutaneous nodules on the palmar surface of both hands were also observed. She received deoxycoformycin, which was stopped because of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Corticosteroid treatment was initiated, with gradual improvement. She suffered from recurrent opportunistic infections. She is currently under interferon and zidovudine therapy with stable blood parameters. Chemotherapy was administered to the other patient with > 50% initial response. Both patients' families were tested for serum anti HTLV-I antibodies and their mates were found to be positive; they also had detectable viral DNA by PCR analysis while asymptomatic, with no abnormal clinical findings and normal white blood cell count and morphology. In conclusion, the two aforementioned patients are the first fully documented ATLL patients described in Greece. Investigation for HTLV-I antibodies should be mandatory in all patients with T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.|\n",

      "|Adult T-cell Leukemia-lymphoma with Primary Breast Involvement: A Case Report and Literature Review.|10.1007/s12185-022-03447-0|  26635405 |After cell-to-cell transmission, HTLV-I increases its viral genome by de novo infection and proliferation of infected cells. Proliferation of infected cells is clonal and persistent in vivo. During the carrier state, infected cells are selected in vivo by the host's immune system, the genetic and epigenetic environment of proviral integration sites, and other factors. In leukemic cells, tax gene expression is frequently impaired by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Such loss of Tax expression enables ATL cells to escape the host immune system. On the other hand, ATL cells acquire the ability to proliferate without Tax by intracellular genetic and epigenetic changes. Despite advances in support and the development of novel treatment agents, the prognosis for ATLL remains poor. A number of therapies, however, do appear to improve prognosis compared to CHOP (VEPA). These include interferon-alpha plus zidovudine (probably after 1-2 cycles of CHOP), intensive chemotherapy as in LSG-15 with G-CSF support and Allo-SCT (which includes the potential for cure). Emerging novel approaches include HDAC inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and proteasome inhibitors. Comparison between different therapeutic approaches is complicated by the range of natural history of ATLL, different recruitments of naÃ¯ve-to-therapy, refractory or relapsed patients, and variations in the reporting of outcome that frequently excludes difficult-to-evaluate patients. Moreover, results from relatively small proof-of-principle studies have not been extended with randomized, controlled trials. As a result, currently, there is no clear evidence to support the value of any particular treatment approach over others. To avoid further unnecessary patient suffering and to identify optimal therapy as rapidly as possible, large randomized, controlled trials encompassing multicenter, international collaborations will be necessary.|\n",

Between 3% and 5% of HTLV-1-infected individuals develop ATL after a long latency. Confirmation of seropositivity of anti-HTLV-1 antibody, and clonal proliferation of CD4 and CD25 positive lymphocytes with nuclear pleomorphism in patients suspicious of malignant lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia is crucial for the diagnosis of ATL. The clinical course of ATL is very heterogeneous, and divided into acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The chronic type is further subclassified into the favorable and unfavorable subtypes. Acute, lymphoma, and unfavorable chronic type ATL, and favorable chronic and smoldering type ATL are defined as aggressive and indolent ATL, respectively. Recently identified prognostic indices based on clinical parameters and/or genetic predictors of outcomes need to be confirmed and incorporated for more stratified therapeutic interventions. The standard of care for aggressive ATL is multiagent chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation if possible, while that for indolent ATL is watchful waiting until progression to aggressive ATL. The combination of interferon-Î± and zidovudine is also standard for leukemic type ATL. In addition, mogamulizumab, lenalidomide, and brentuximab vedotin have been incorporated into clinical practices in Japan. Furthermore, several novel drugs are currently undergoing clinical trials.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.|\n",

As HTLV-1 is endemic in native ethnics in South America, and its infection leads to several chronic diseases as ATLL with poor prognosis, we aimed to present three ATLL cases and to review current literature.Two cases were from the mountains of Peru, while one was from an endemic harbor of the country. An acute ATLL patient presented with multipapular infiltration of the skin and died 2 weeks after admission because of septic shock. The two chronic ATLL patients presented with erythematous plaques and erythroderma. They had swollen lymph nodes, lymphocytosis, and atypical lymphocytes on blood smear, with normal biochemical results. They both passed away a few months after diagnosis.ATLL is developed after years of HTLV-1 carrier status; therefore, physicians should know the principal clinical and laboratory findings in order to make prompt diagnosis. Prognosis is still poor in aggressive and indolent variants, with survival rates from months to a few years. Treatment based on chemotherapy, antiretroviral, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation are improving survival rates but with limited results.Â© 2017 The International Society of Dermatology.|\n",

We have observed that some patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) develop ATLL during treatment at our hospital. The aim of this study was to examine treatment factors associated with onset of ATLL through an evaluation of the therapeutic background of these patients.The impact of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery on occurrence of ATLL was evaluated in 146 patients with head and neck SCC who were treated at our hospital between April 2010 and December 2013.Of 146 patients, 17 were HTLV-1 positive and 6 developed ATLL. There was a significant relationship between ATLL development and administration of S-1 chemotherapy (p=0.0003), but not with use of radiotherapy, surgery or other drugs.The involvement of S-1 chemotherapy in ATLL development suggests that a test for HTLV-1 antibody should be performed before treatment and that S-1 should not be administered in HTLV-1 positive patients with head and neck carcinoma.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Several clinical studies have shown that discontinuation of immunosuppressant therapy induces durable remission in a significant number of post-transplant relapsed patients, suggesting that ATLL may be susceptible to a graft-versus-leukemia effect. Here, we report two cases with ATLL who received donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) for relapse after allo-HSCT; one patient achieved complete remission (CR) after a single DLI, and the other suffered repeated relapses and was treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy combined with a total of five rounds of DLIs. Both patients presented with exacerbation of the graft-versus-host disease after the DLIs, and remained in CR for 9 and 8 years, respectively. These data support the use of DLIs as an effective therapy to induce durable CR in the treatment of relapsed ATLL. In this study, we review previous reports and discuss the role of DLIs in the treatment of post-transplant relapsed ATLL.|\n",

In this study, we developed various antibodies as diagnostic tools to identify CADM1-positive ATLL leukemia cells. In flow cytometric analysis, the percentages of CD4(+)CADM1(+) double-positive cells correlated well with both the percentages of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells and with abnormal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with various types of ATLL. Moreover, the degree of CD4(+)CADM1(+) cells over 1% significantly correlated with the copy number of the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) provirus in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1 carriers and ATLL patients. We also identified a soluble form of CADM1 in the peripheral blood of ATLL patients, and the expression levels of this form were correlated with the levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptor alpha. Moreover, lymphomas derived from ATLL were strongly and specifically stained with a CADM1 antibody. Thus, detection of CD4(+)CADM1(+) cells in the peripheral blood, measurement of serum levels of soluble CADM1 and immunohistochemical detection of CADM1 in lymphomas would be a useful set of markers for disease progression in ATLL and may aid in both the early diagnosis and measurement of treatment efficacy for ATLL.|\n",

To illuminate the pathogenesis of ATLL we performed whole transcriptome sequencing of purified ATLL patient samples and discovered recurrent somatic mutations in CCR4, encoding CC chemokine receptor 4. CCR4 mutations were detected in 14/53 ATLL samples (26%) and consisted exclusively of nonsense or frameshift mutations that truncated the coding region at C329, Q330, or Y331 in the carboxy terminus. Functionally, the CCR4-Q330 nonsense isoform was gain-of-function because it increased cell migration toward the CCR4 ligands CCL17 and CCL22, in part by impairing receptor internalization. This mutant enhanced PI(3) kinase/AKT activation after receptor engagement by CCL22 in ATLL cells and conferred a growth advantage in long-term in vitro cultures. These findings implicate somatic gain-of-function CCR4 mutations in the pathogenesis of ATLL and suggest that inhibition of CCR4 signaling might have therapeutic potential in this refractory malignancy.|\n",

Cardiac involvement in patients with ATLL is infrequent, and when it happens it is usually seen in aggressive ATLL subtypes. However, ATLL presenting as isolated cardiac valve involvement is extremely rare. To date, only three histologically proven cases of ATLL with isolated cardiac valve involvement have been reported. Herein, we describe a 61-year-old Peruvian man who presented heart failure symptoms secondary to progressive cardiac valve infiltration. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis. Histopathological evaluation of the resected valve revealed leaflet thickening with a nodular appearance due to fibrous tissue containing atypical T-lymphocytes with Foxp3 expression, infiltrating all layers of the resected valve. Interestingly, tumor cells were distributed around an incidental venous malformation (i.e., cavernous hemangioma). Postoperative evaluation demonstrated positive serology for HTLV-1, and a diagnosis of ATLL was established. Postoperative positron emission tomography/computed tomography did not show lesions outside the heart and cell blood counts were within normal range with low level of circulating CD4+ CD25+ lymphoma cell counts (7%); therefore, patient's disease was considered as smoldering ATLL and a \"watch and wait\" strategy was pursued. Currently, the patient is alive with no progression of disease after 18 months from diagnosis. Isolated cardiac valve involvement by ATLL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of HTLV-1 carriers with progressive heart failure, even when systemic lymphoma involvement is absent or not apparent.Copyright Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) has no effective therapy and high levels of cell surface transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) expression have been reported in ATLL by us and other groups. In this study, to develop a novel molecular-targeted therapy against TFR1 to modulate iron metabolism, we initially determined the expression pattern of several iron-related genes along with TFR1 and found that ATLL cells presented characteristic of an iron-deficiency state such as high expression of iron-regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) and low expression of its E3 ubiquitin-ligase, FBXL5. Therefore, we developed human IgG monoclonal antibodies to human TFR1 using a phage display method (ICOS method) to block the incorporation of the transferrin (TF)-iron complex into ATLL cells for inhibiting cell growth. One of the mAbs, JST-TFR09, presented its greater affinity to TFR1 on ATLL cells in flow cytometry (FCM) analysis than those of commercially available anti-TFR1 antibodies and identified high expression of TFR1 in most of the acute-type ATLL cells. Moreover, JST-TFR09 could interfere with binding between TFR1 and TF, which resulted in effective blockade of TFR1 internalization and induction of cell apoptosis by the treatment of ATLL cells with JST-TFR09. JST-TFR09 showed dual activities through direct cell cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and the treatment of JST-TFR09 significantly suppressed cell growth of ATLL cells with induction of apoptosis in inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo experiments. Thus, JST-TFR09 described here may become a promising therapeutic antibody for the treatment of ATLL.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.|\n",

Gain-of-function genetic alterations involving CD28 have been frequently observed in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). These abnormalities, such as CD28 fusions and copy number variations, may not only confer continuous, prolonged, and enhanced CD28 signaling to downstream pathways but also induce overexpression of the CD28 protein. In this study, 120 ATLL cases were examined by immunohistochemistry for CD28 and its ligands CD80 and CD86, and their expression on tumor cells was semiquantitatively evaluated. CD28 was overexpressed in 55 (46%) cases, and CD80 or CD86 (CD80/CD86) was infrequently overexpressed in 12 (11%). Compared with non-overexpressers, CD28 overexpressers showed a higher frequency of CD28 genetic alterations and had an increased number of CD80/CD86-positive non-neoplastic cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment. In the entire ATLL patient cohort, CD28 overexpressers showed a significantly poorer overall survival (OS) compared with non-overexpressers (PÂ =Â .001). The same was true for a subgroup who were treated with multidrug regimens with or without mogamulizumab. CD28 overexpression had no prognostic impact in the group who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the multivariate analysis for OS, CD28 overexpression was selected as an independent risk factor. These results suggest ATLL patients with CD28 overexpression have more aggressive clinical course and are more refractory to treatment with multidrug chemotherapy. CD28 overexpression appears to be a novel unfavorable prognostic marker in ATLL patients, and further prospective studies are warranted to establish its prognostic significance.Â© 2021 The Authors.

However, the efficacy of this regimen has not been fully elucidated for patients aged 70 years or older. Here, we retrospectively analyzed elderly patients with aggressive ATL at Nagasaki University Hospital between 1994 and 2010 to assess treatment outcomes. Of 148 evaluable patients, 54 were aged 70 years or older at diagnosis. The median survival time (MST) and overall survival (OS) at 2 years in elderly patients were 10.6 months and 22.1%, respectively. Thirty-four patients received VCAP-AMP-VECP as the initial treatment, although the doses were reduced for most patients. In these patients, MST and OS at 2 years were 13.4 months and 26.6%, respectively. Eleven of 34 patients (32%) received maintenance oral chemotherapy after two or three cycles of VCAP-AMP-VECP, and MST and OS at 2 years were 16.7 months and 32.7%, respectively. Our results suggest that the VCAP-AMP-VECP regimen may be effective and that maintenance oral chemotherapy may be considered as a therapeutic option for elderly patients with aggressive ATL.|\n",

Most ATLL patients fare poorly with conventional chemotherapy; however, antiviral therapy with zidovudine (AZT) and interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) has produced long-term clinical remissions. We studied primary ATLL tumors and identified molecular features linked to sensitivity and resistance to antiviral therapy. Enhanced expression of the proto-oncogene c-Rel was noted in 9 of 27 tumors. Resistant tumors exhibited c-Rel (6 of 10; 60%) more often than did sensitive variants (1 of 9; 11%). This finding was independent of the disease form. Elevated expression of the putative c-Rel target, interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF-4), was observed in 10 (91%) of 11 nonresponders and in all tested patients with c-Rel+ tumors and occurred in the absence of the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax. In contrast, tumors in complete responders did not express c-Rel or IRF-4. Gene rearrangement studies demonstrated the persistence of circulating T-cell clones in long-term survivors maintained on antiviral therapy. The expression of nuclear c-Rel and IRF-4 occurs in the absence of Tax in primary ATLL and is associated with antiviral resistance. These molecular features may help guide treatment. AZT and IFN-alpha is a suppressive rather than a curative regimen, and patients in clinical remission should remain on maintenance therapy indefinitely.|\n",

Intensive conventional chemotherapy regimens and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have failed to improve outcomes in ATLL. Allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) is commonly offered as front-line consolidation despite lack of randomized controlled trials. We performed a comprehensive search of the medical literature using PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane reviews on September 10, 2018. We extracted data on clinical outcomes related to benefits (complete response [CR], overall survival [OS], and progression-free survival [PFS]) and harms (relapse and nonrelapse mortality [NRM]), independently by 2 authors. Our search strategy identified a total of 801 references. Nineteen studies (nâ¯=â¯2446 patients) were included in the systematic review; however, only 18 studies (nâ¯=â¯1767 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Reduced intensity conditioning regimens were more commonly prescribed (52%). Bone marrow (50%) and peripheral blood (40%) were more frequently used as stem cell source. The pooled post-allografting CR, OS, and PFS rates were 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57% to 87%), 40% (95% CI, 33% to 46%), and 37% (95% CI, 27% to 48%), respectively. Pooled relapse and NRM rates were 36% (95% CI, 28% to 43%) and 29% (95% CI, 21% to 37%), respectively. The heterogeneity among the included studies was generally high. These results support the use of allo-HCT as an effective treatment for patients with ATLL, yielding pooled OS rates of 40%, but relapse still occurs in over one-third of cases. Future studies should evaluate strategies to help reduce relapse in patients with ATLL undergoing allo-HCT.Copyright Â© 2019 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

As CCR4 is highly expressed on regulatory T cells as well as ATLL cells, pre-transplant MOG induces severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). However, limited data are available on post-transplant use of MOG for relapsed ATLL. Here we describe the case of a patient with ATLL who experienced post-transplant relapse with involvement of peripheral blood, skin, lungs, and lymph nodes. Neither tacrolimus dose reduction nor cytotoxic chemotherapy was effective, but a single dose of MOG (1Â mg/kg) induced complete remission. After treatment with MOG, leukemic cells in the peripheral blood rapidly disappeared, and the skin, lymph node, and lung lesions gradually regressed. Most notably, the long-term remission was accompanied by recurrence of moderate acute GvHD (grade II, skin stage 2, gut stage 1, liver stage 0). Our findings indicate that MOG can augment allogeneic immune-mediated anti-tumor reactions through graft-versus-ATLL (GvATLL) even during post-transplant relapse involving the lymph nodes and lungs, along with inducing GvHD.Â© 2022.

Promising results have been reported with the combination of zidovudine (AZT) and alpha-interferon (IFN).A combination with IFN and antinucleoside [AZT or zalcitabine (ddC)] was applied since 1995 in Martinique (French West Indies). An initial treatment with two cycles of CHOP was added to reduce initial tumoral burden, followed by antiretroviral (ARV) therapy associated with etoposide. We report the characteristics and outcomes of 29 patients diagnosed with an ATLL between 1990 and 1999. The overall median survival was 8 months. A striking improvement of survival was observed when comparing the periods between 1990-1994 and 1995-1999 (17 months versus 3 months, p = 0.004). During the second period, seven patients received a therapy with oral etoposide, antinucleoside and IFN, among which, six patients received an initial induction CHOP chemotherapy. No major toxicity was observed with this strategy. In conclusion, the progression of survival since 1995 suggests that a therapeutic approach combining initial polychemotherapy with CHOP followed by ARV drugs, IFN and oral etoposide is an interesting option in treating patients with ATLL.|\n",

An important mechanism of the activated NF-ÎºB signaling pathway in ATLL is the activation of the macroautophagy (herafter referred to as autophagy in the remainder of this manuscript)-lysosomal degradation of p47 (NSFL1C), a negative regulator of the NF-ÎºB pathway. Therefore, we considered the use of chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (CQ/HCQ) as an autophagy inhibitor to treat ATLL; these drugs were originally approved by the FDA as antimalarial drugs and have recently been used to treat autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In this paper, we determined the therapeutic efficacy of CQ/HCQ, as NF-ÎºB inhibitors, in ATLL mediated by blockade of p47 degradation. Administration of CQ/HCQ to ATLL cell lines and primary ATLL cells induced cell growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner, and the majority of cells underwent apoptosis after CQ administration. As to the molecular mechanism, autophagy was inhibited in CQ-treated ATLL cells, and activation of the NF-ÎºB pathway was suppressed with the restoration of the p47 level. When the antitumor effect of CQ/HCQ was examined using immunodeficient mice transplanted with ATLL cell lines, CQ/HCQ significantly suppressed tumor growth and improved the survival rate in the ATLL xenograft mouse model. Importantly, HCQ selectively induced ATLL cell death in the ATLL xenograft mouse model at the dose used to treat SLE. Taken together, our results suggest that the inhibition of autophagy by CQ/HCQ may become a novel and effective strategy for the treatment of ATLL.|\n",

To clarify which patients with ATLL are likely to benefit from these treatment options and to define patient populations for novel treatments, we performed a nationwide retrospective analysis of 252 Japanese patients who had relapsed ATLL after allo-HSCT. Some long-term survivors remained after tapering and withdrawal of immunosuppressive agents. Thirty-six patients who received donor lymphocyte infusion had a better overall survival (OS) in comparison to those who did not [hazard ratio (HR), 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43-0.93; PÂ =Â .02], suggesting the efficacy of a graft-versus-ATLL (GvATLL) effect even after relapse. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that skin lesions at initial relapse of ATLL were independently associated with higher OS (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.22-0.74; PÂ =Â .003), indicating that the skin is a susceptible target organ of GvATLL. This study suggested that enhancement of a GvATLL effect is a potential therapeutic option for relapsed disease after allo-HSCT. Further investigations of incorporation of immune-based approaches with new molecular target drugs into the therapeutic options of patients with ATLL before and after transplantation are warranted.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.|\n",

We previously identified that cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) is overexpressed consistently in ATLL cells, and that CADM1 expression increases the adhesion capacity of ATLL cells to endothelial cells and promotes the organ invasion of ATLL cells in a xenograft mouse model. In this study, we first show that newly developed several anti-human CADM1 antibodies, which were complete human IgG antibodies generated by phage display method, specifically recognize CADM1 on ATLL cells. Although most of the CADM1 antibodies did not have a direct cytotoxic effect against CADM1-positive ATLL cells, clone 089-084 exhibited weak but significant antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic activity. Moreover, clone 103-189 effectively inhibits the interaction between endothelial cells and CADM1-positive ATLL cells. Furthermore, in mice bearing intra-splenic transplantation of EL4 mouse lymphoma cells expressing CADM1, the treatment of 103-189 significantly suppressed the organ invasion of CADM1-positive EL4 cells, resulting in improved survival time of mice. Therefore, since the anti-CADM1 antibody may be useful for the suppression of organ invasion in ATLL patients, combination use of the anti-CADM1 antibody with chemotherapy drugs could be beneficial for the efficient elimination of ATLL cells.|\n",

We previously reported that programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression could predict ATLL outcomes. However, the roles of other immune checkpoint molecules remain largely unknown in ATLL. Our aim in this study was to explore the clinicopathological impacts of immune checkpoint molecules in ATLL. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 69 ATLL patients with antibodies against the following: PD-L1, programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), OX40, OX40 ligand (OX40L), CD137, CD137 ligand (CD137L), Galectin-9, T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3), cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), lymphocyte activating-3 (LAG-3), CD80, CD86, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein (GITR), GITR ligand (GITRL), and programmed death-1 (PD-1). Immune checkpoint molecules were variably expressed on neoplastic and/or microenvironmental cells. Expression of PD-1, OX40L, Galectin-9, and PD-L1 was nearly mutually exclusive on neoplastic cells, suggesting that immune checkpoint pathways differ in patients. Microenvironmental expression of PD-L1, OX40L, and Tim-3 was significantly associated with better overall survival (log-rank test; Pâ=0.0004, 0.0394, and 0.0279, respectively).

We began performing allogeneic BMT from unrelated donors in 1999 to improve the outcome of ATLL patients with no suitable sibling donors. Eight ATLL patients underwent unrelated BMT; five received the conventional conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, while three received a reduced-intensity preparative regimen. Two patients died due to encephalopathy of unknown aetiology on days 10 and 35, and one patient died due to progression of ATLL 25 months after BMT. Five patients are currently alive and disease-free at a median of 20 months after BMT. Proviral human T-lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) DNA load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was assessed in four cases before and after BMT.

Accordingly, HTLV-1-infected cells lose Tax expression and acquire Tax-independent NF-kappaB activation. Blocking NF-kappaB not only induces apoptosis in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells but also reduces the number of HTLV-1-infected cells in virus carriers.

Recurrent somatic mutations in host genes have exposed the T-cell receptor pathway through nuclear factor ÎºB to interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) as an essential driver for this malignancy. We sought to determine if IRF4 represents a therapeutic target for ATLL and to identify downstream effectors and biomarkers of IRF4 signaling in vivo.ATLL cell lines, particularly Tax viral oncoprotein-negative cell lines, that most closely resemble ATLL in humans, were sensitive to dose- and time-dependent inhibition by a next-generation class of IRF4 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that employ constrained ethyl residues that mediate RNase H-dependent RNA degradation. ATLL cell lines were also sensitive to lenalidomide, which repressed IRF4 expression. Both ASOs and lenalidomide inhibited ATLL proliferation in vitro and in vivo. To identify biomarkers of IRF4-mediated CD4â+âT-cell expansion in vivo, transcriptomic analysis identified several genes that encode key regulators of ATLL, including interleukin 2 receptor subunits Î± and Î², KIT ligand, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, and thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group protein TOX 2.These data support the pursuit of IRF4 as a therapeutic target in ATLL with the use of either ASOs or lenalidomide.|\n",

In this 5-y prospective cohort study, we determined the mortality, prevalence, and incidence of ATLL in 527 HAM/TSP patients. The standard mortality ratio of HAM/TSP patients was 2.25, and ATLL was one of the major causes of death (5/33 deaths). ATLL prevalence and incidence in these patients were 3.0% and 3.81 per 1,000 person-y, respectively. To identify patients at a high risk of developing ATLL, flow cytometry, Southern blotting, and targeted sequencing data were analyzed in a separate cohort of 218 HAM/TSP patients. In 17% of the HAM/TSP patients, we identified an increase in T cells positive for cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), a marker for ATLL and HTLV-1-infected cells. Genomic analysis revealed that somatic mutations of HTLV-1-infected cells were seen in 90% of these cases and 11% of them had dominant clone and developed ATLL in the longitudinal observation. In this study, we were able to demonstrate the increased mortality in patients with HAM/TSP and a significant effect of ATLL on their prognosis.

HTLV-1 infection was determined by measuring HTLV-1 antibody titer in the common marmosets.The HTLV-1 antibody titer increased in the intraperitoneally inoculated marmoset with or without CsA treatment, and it kept over five 5Â years though proviral copy number (proviral load, PVL) remained low throughout the study.We obtained HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers of common marmosets by inoculating MT-2 cells.Â© 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

GSK-3Î² blockade downregulates the NF-ÎºB pathway, modulates immune cell PD-1 and tumor cell PD-L1 expression, and increases CD8Â +Â T cell and NK cell function. We report a case of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) treated with 9-ING-41, a selective GSK-3Î² inhibitor in clinical development, who achieved a durable response. A 43-year-old male developed diffuse lymphadenopathy, and biopsy of axillary lymph node showed acute-type ATLL. Peripheral blood flow cytometry revealed a circulating clonal T cell population, and CSF was positive for ATLL involvement. After disease progression on the 3rd line of treatment, he started treatment with 9-ING-41 monotherapy in a clinical trial (NCT03678883). CT imaging after seven months showed a partial response. Sustained reduction of peripheral blood ATLL cells lasted 15Â months. Treatment of patient-derived CD8Â +Â T cells with 9-ING-41 increased the secretion of IFN-Î³, granzyme B, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). In conclusion, treatment of a patient with refractory ATLL with the GSK-3Î² inhibitor 9-ING-41 resulted in a prolonged response. Ongoing experiments are investigating the hypothesis that 9-ING-41-induced T cell activation and immunomodulation contributes to its clinical activity. Further clinical investigation of 9-ING-41 for treatment of ATLL is warranted.|\n",

Novel long-term cultures and in vivo xenograft models were developed using primary ATLL cells from North American patients. Two PAK inhibitors were used to block PAK kinase activity pharmacologically. siRNA-based gene silencing approach was used to genetically knockdown (KD) PAK1 and PAK2 in ATLL cell lines.PAK1/2/4 are the three most abundantly expressed PAK family members in ATLL. PAK2 amplifications are seen in 24% of ATLLs and are associated with worse prognosis in a large patient cohort. The pan-PAK inhibitor PF-3758309 (PF) has strong in vitro and in vivo activity in a variety of ATLL preclinical models. These activities of PF are likely attributed to its ability to target several PAK isoforms simultaneously because genetic silencing of either PAK1 or PAK2 produced more modest effects. PAK2 plays a major role in CADM1-mediated stromal interaction, which is an important step in systemic dissemination of the disease. This finding is consistent with the observation that PAK2 amplification is more frequent in aggressive ATLLs and correlates with inferior outcome.PAK2, a gene frequently amplified in ATLL, facilitates CADM1-mediated stromal interaction and promotes survival of ATLL cells. Taken together, PAK inhibition may hold significant promise as a targeted therapy for aggressive ATLLs.Â©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.|\n",

Sigmoidoscopy revealed multiple superficial erosions surrounded by a flare. Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonogram of the abdomen revealed marked thickening of the colonic mucosa. There were 186 CMV antigen-positive leukocytes per 31,000 white blood cells (WBC). A colonic biopsy specimen showed typical CMV nuclear inclusions. Immunohistological study of the specimen was positive for CMV antigen. Administration of ganciclovir (DHPG) 500 mg/day for 14 days improved the diarrhea and other symptoms. On day 30 of the chemotherapy, the patient developed diarrhea again but was diagnosed with pseudomembranous colitis instead of CMV colitis. At that time, CMV antigenemia and a histologic study for CMV were negative. The stool was positive for Clostridium difficile toxin antigen. ATLL patients are believed to be immunocompromised hosts and often develop opportunistic infections such as CMV infection. Most suffer from CMV pneumonia at the end of their course of therapy. Few gastrointestinal (GI) CMV infections are seen in ATLL patients and details of CMV colitis have never been reported. When an ATLL patient develops diarrhea that barely responds to conventional therapy, CMV colitis and pseudomembranous colitis should be listed in the differential diagnosis.|\n",

In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed 35 patients who experienced progression of or relapsed persistent ATL after a first allo-SCT at 3 institutions in Nagasaki prefecture (Japan) between 1997 and 2010. Twenty-nine patients were treated by the withdrawal of immune suppressants as the initial intervention, which resulted in complete remission (CR) in 2 patients. As the second intervention, 9 patients went on to receive a combination of donor lymphocyte infusion and cytoreductive therapy and CR was achieved in 4 patients. Of 6 patients who had already had their immune suppressants discontinued before the relapse, 3 patients with local recurrence received local cytoreductive therapy as the initial treatment, which resulted in CR for more than 19 months. Donor lymphocyte infusion-induced remissions of ATL were durable, with 3 cases of long-term remission of more than 3 years and, interestingly, the emergence or progression of chronic GVHD was observed in all of these cases. For all 35 patients, overall survival after relapse was 19.3% at 3 years. The results of the present study suggest that induction of a graft-versus-ATL effect may be crucial to obtaining durable remission for ATL patients with relapse or progression after allo-SCT.|\n",

There is no standard treatment for relapsed or refractory (r/r) ATL, and clinical outcomes are poor. This systematic review examined the survival outcomes for r/r ATL treated with various systemic therapies.EMBASE and PubMed were searched for studies on r/r ATL, published between January 2010 and January 2020. The main outcome of interest was overall survival (OS). Median OS and an exploratory 30% OS time were assessed based on published data and Kaplan-Meier curves.There were 21 unique treatment subgroups (from 14Â studies), that met the eligibility criteria. Nine subgroups were mogamulizumab treatment, two were mogamulizumab prior to allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), five were allo-HSCT, and five were other chemotherapy. Respectively, the median OS and 30% OS varied considerably in range for mogamulizumab treatment (2.2-17.6Â months and 8.7-27.1Â months), allo-HSCT (3.8-6.2Â months and 7.5-19.8Â months), and other chemotherapy arms (4.1-20.3Â months and 7.1-17.0Â months).Mogamulizumab was the most frequently studied treatment regimen and can potentially provide longer survival compared with chemotherapy alone. Future comparisons with synthetic or historical control arms may enable clearer insights into treatment efficacy.Â© 2021 Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.

An analysis of the ascites and laboratory tests revealed no evidence of ATLL invasion, infectious disease, or liver cirrhosis. The mogamulizumab concentrations were maintained in the ascites at approximately 10-15% of that in the plasma. Mogamulizumab was considered to be a plausible pathogenesis of her ascites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting mogamulizumab-induced ascites.|\n",

      "|Development of anti-human CADM1 monoclonal antibodies as a potential therapy for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.|10.1111/bjh.15744|  31610149 |Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is caused by the HTLV-1 virus, endemic to Japan and the Caribbean, and is likely derived from cells with the T-regulatory phenotype. The malignant cells express IL2 receptor Î± (CD25), and the majority express transcription factor Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), in addition to T-cell markers. Occasional cases express CD30. Whereas Japanese cases are predominantly of the acute and chronic leukemic types, the less well-studied Caribbean cases are more often lymphomatous. We performed immunohistochemical analysis for CD25, Foxp3, and CD30 on samples from 42 US/Caribbean ATLL patients and correlated these markers with morphologic subtype and clinical characteristics. In the 16/42 patients who had successive biopsies, we determined the expression stability of these markers. Foxp3 was expressed in 26 of the 42 (62%) initial biopsies, and its intensity correlated with CD25 expression. It was more frequent in pleomorphic small-sized and medium-sized cell types than in large cell tumors but did not correlate with patients' clinical attributes. Foxp3 expression and morphology were unchanged in successive biopsies in 13 of 16 patients. Four initial biopsies had features of anaplastic large cell T lymphomas, all of which were Foxp3. Successive biopsies from 2 patients with pleomorphic medium cell variant showed diminishing expression of originally weak Foxp3 expression and de novo CD30 expression, whereas they showed morphologic progression to the anaplastic cell variant. A third patient's second biopsy revealed progression from pleomorphic medium to anaplastic large cell morphology with loss of Foxp3, but it remained CD30. Foxp3 expression correlates with pleomorphic small and medium cell types and may be lost with large cell transformation. The evolution of the latter type can be associated with the gain of CD30 expression; such ATLL tumors might respond to anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody therapies.|\n",

Considering the dismal prognosis associated with conventional chemotherapies, early application of allo-HSCT might be beneficial for patients with ATLL. However, no previous study has addressed the optimal timing of allo-HSCT from related donors. Hence, to evaluate the impact of timing of allo-HSCT for patients with ATLL, we retrospectively analyzed data from patients with ATLL who received an allo-HSCT from a related donor. The median age was 52 years. Patients were grouped according to the interval from diagnosis to allo-HSCT: early transplant group, <100 days, n=72; late transplant group, â©¾100 days, n=428. The corresponding constituents of disease status were not statistically different between the two groups (P=0.11). The probability of OS in the early transplant group was significantly higher than that in the late transplant group (4-year OS, 49.3% vs 31.2%). Multivariate analysis revealed that late allo-HSCT was an unfavorable prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-2.11; P=0.04). Despite the limitations of a retrospective study, it might be acceptable to consider early application of allo-HSCT for ATLL.|\n",

We report a rare case of primary adrenal adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (primary adrenal ATLL). ATLL is a highly aggressive T-cell type non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and etiologically associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1). Most ATLL patients present with leukemia and widespread lymphadenopathy. A 37-year-old Japanese woman presented with back pain in January 2004. Examination showed no peripheral lymphadenopathy, circulating lymphoma cells, hepatosplenomegaly, and skin lesions. Imaging studies demonstrated large adrenal masses bilaterally. Subsequently, she underwent open adrenal biopsy and pathological diagnosis was confirmed as T-cell lymphoma. The serum antibody to HTLV-1 was positive. Southern blot analysis detected monoclonal integration of proviral DNA of HTLV-1 into host genome in the biopsy specimen. The diagnosis of ATLL arising in adrenal glands was established. Despite repeated systemic chemotherapy, the patient died of progressive disease in December 2004. ATLL could primarily involve the adrenal gland and this disease entity should be included in the differential diagnosis of adrenal mass lesions.|\n",

Survival in aggressive subtypes remains poor, and treatment resistance is frequent. Use of zidovudine (ZDV) and interferon alfa (IFN-Î±) has been associated with improved response rates in small studies and prolonged overall survival in leukemic ATLL subtypes in a recent meta-analysis.We report the clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment, and outcome of 73 patients with aggressive ATLL (acute ATLL, 29; lymphoma ATLL, 44) diagnosed and treated in England between 1999 and 2009. The impact of ZDV/IFN-Î± on treatment response and survival was assessed.The overall response rate ranged from 49% with chemotherapy alone to 81% with combined first-line therapy (chemotherapy with concurrent/sequential ZDV/IFN-Î±). Median overall survival (OS) was 9 months: 7.5 months for acute ATLL and 10 months for lymphoma ATLL. Use of ZDV/IFN-Î± at any time prolonged survival in acute (P < .001) and lymphoma ATLL (P < .001) and was the sole factor associated with reduction in risk of death in aggressive ATLL (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.60; P = .002). Combined first-line therapy prolonged median OS in acute (P = .0081) and lymphoma ATLL (P = .001) compared with chemotherapy alone.These data support the use of low-dose ZDV/IFN-Î± with chemotherapy in first-line treatment of acute and lymphoma ATLL.|\n",

Here, we have explored the possible expression of cancer/testis (CT) antigens by ATLL cells, as CT antigens are widely recognized as ideal targets of cancer immunotherapy against solid tumors. A high percentage (87.7%) of ATLL cases (n = 57) expressed CT antigens at the mRNA level: NY-ESO-1 (61.4%), MAGE-A3 (31.6%), and MAGE-A4 (61.4%). CT antigen expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. This contrasts with other types of lymphoma or leukemia, which scarcely express these CT antigens. Humoral immune responses, particularly against NY-ESO-1, were detected in 11.6% (5 of 43) and NY-ESO-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses were observed in 55.6% (5 of 9) of ATLL patients. NY-ESO-1-specific CD8(+) T cells recognized autologous ATLL cells and produced effector cytokines. Thus, ATLL cells characteristically express CT antigens and therefore vaccination with CT antigens can be an effective immunotherapy of ATLL.|\n",

The method of diagnosis and mechanism of immune regulation in ATLL are discussed in the present report.A 51-year-old Chinese man was admitted to the hospital with 2-years history of systemic plaque lesions and 1-year history of left ankle joint pain.The patient was diagnosed with ATLL based on the results of flow cytometry immunophenotype and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) serology.The patient received 3 cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin/ vinorelbine, and dexamethasone (CHOP) chemotherapy. However, he relapsed and did not respond to epirubicin, vindesine, etoposide, dexamethasone (EPOCH) chemotherapy.His family discontinued the treatment and opted for hospice care.Patch and plaque ATLL types exhibits a better survival rate, but atypical skin patches delays the diagnosis of ATLL and negatively affects the patient survival. Based on the present findings, we suggest that patients with petal-like nuclear lymphocytes in blood smears, a high CD4: CD8 ratio, and strong CD25 expression should undergo HTLV-1 serology testing.|\n",
