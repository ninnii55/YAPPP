Overall survival in the aggressive subtypes (Acute Leukaemia and Lymphomatous) remains poor in part due to chemotherapy resistance. To improve treatment outcome for de novo disease, better induction therapies are required and since the pathogenic agent is known it would seem sensible to target the virus. In a recent meta-analysis the use of zidovudine and interferon alpha (ZDV/IFN) has been associated with improved response rates and prolonged overall survival in leukemic subtypes of ATLL (both acute and Chronic) confirmed in a multivariate analysis. In a more recent UK study the overall response rate for patients with aggressive ATLL treated with chemotherapy alone was 49 % compared to 81 % with combined first line therapy (chemotherapy with concurrent or sequential ZDV/IFN). Combined first line therapy prolonged median OS in acute (p = 0.0081) and lymphomatous ATLL (p = 0.001).These data support the use of low dose ZDV/IFN with chemotherapy as first line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed aggressive ATLL. Although the mechanisms of action are incompletely understood, some possible explanations for their efficacy will be discussed.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.1007/s11899-012-0139-9,23093306

HTLV-1 was brought to the World Health Organization (WHO) and researchers to address its impact on global public health, oncogenicity, and deterioration of the host immune system toward autoimmunity. In a minority of the infected population (3-5%), it can induce inflammatory networks toward HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), or hijacking the infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes into T regulatory subpopulation, stimulating anti-inflammatory signaling networks, and prompting ATLL development. This review critically discusses the complex signaling networks in ATLL pathogenesis during virus-host interactions for better interpretation of oncogenicity and introduces the main candidates in the pathogenesis of ATLL. At least two viral factors, HTLV-1 trans-activator protein (TAX) and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ), are implicated in ATLL manifestation, interacting with host responses and deregulating cell signaling in favor of infected cell survival and virus dissemination. Such molecules can be used as potential novel biomarkers for ATLL prognosis or targets for therapy. Moreover, the challenging aspects of HTLV-1 oncogenesis introduced in this review could open new venues for further studies on acute leukemia pathogenesis. These features can aid in the discovery of effective immunotherapies when reversing the gene expression profile toward appropriate immune responses gradually becomes attainable.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.1007/s00262-022-03301-6,34937829

Although ATLL is quite difficult to be cured, up-regulation of cellular immunity such as HTLV-1 Tax-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) has been proved to be important to obtain long-term survival. At present, no efficacious method to activate ATLL-specific cellular immunity is available. This study aimed to investigate whether live attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccination to ATLL can activate HTLV-1 Tax-specific cellular immune response. A total of 3 indolent- and 3 aggressive-type ATLL patients were enrolled. All aggressive-type patients had the VZV vaccination after completing anti-ATLL treatment including mogamulizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody for C-C chemokine receptor 4 antigen, plus combination chemotherapy, whereas all indolent-type patients had the VZV vaccination without any antitumor treatment. Cellular immune responses including Tax-specific CTLs were analyzed at several time points of pre- and post-VZV vaccination. After the VZV vaccination, a moderate increase in 1 of 3 indolent-type patients and obvious increase in all 3 aggressive-type patients in Tax-specific CTLs percentage were observed. The increase in the cell-mediated immunity against VZV was observed in all indolent- and aggressive-type patients after VZV vaccination. To conclude, VZV vaccination to aggressive-type ATLL patients after mogamulizumab plus chemotherapy led to the up-regulation of HTLV-1 Tax-specific CTLs without any adverse event. Suppression of regulatory T lymphocytes by mogamulizumab may have contributed to increase tumor immunity in aggressive-type ATLL patients.

In recent years, the number of HTLV-1 carriers has decreased due to lifestyle changes and different measures. Rapid progression in comprehensive genetic analysis techniques has revealed the molecular basis of ATL. Therefore, in addition to conventional prognostic indices based on clinical parameters, prognostic indices incorporating genetic mutations have been proposed. The standard treatment for untreated aggressive ATL is combination chemotherapy such as VCAP-AMP-VECP or CHOP, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as appropriate. Combined mogamulizumab and chemotherapy is a promising first-line treatment option for patients not eligible for transplantation. Salvage treatment with lenalidomide, brentuximab vedotin, tucidinostat, and valemetostat, in addition to mogamulizumab, has been introduced over the last decade. Advancements in allogeneic transplantation therapy, including early induction and transplantation with post-transplant cyclophosphamide for GVHD prophylaxis, have also improved patient outcomes.

HTLV-1 is endemic to certain geographic areas of the world, and primary infection generally occurs in infancy through mother-to-child transmission via breastfeeding. In less than 5% of infected individuals, a decades-long pathogenic process culminates in the development of ATL. Aggressive subtypes of ATL are life-threatening and challenging to treat, with median overall survival typically less than 1 year in the absence of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Owing to the rarity of this illness, prospective large-scale clinical trials have been challenging to perform, and treatment recommendations are largely founded upon limited evidence. Herein, we review the current therapeutic options for ATL, providing a broad literature overview of the foremost clinical trials and reports of this disease. We emphasize our own treatment paradigm, which is broadly based upon disease subtype, patient fitness, and intent to perform alloHCT. Finally, we highlight recent advances in understanding ATL disease biology and important ongoing clinical trials that we foresee as informative and potentially practice-changing.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2023.

Prognosis of ATL patients is directly correlated to the subtype of ATL. Treatment of the aggressive forms (acute and lymphoma types) of ATL remains inadequate, as most ATL patients receive conventional chemotherapy without stem cell rescue. At present, LSG15 is the standard chemotherapy for the treatment of aggressive ATL, but the efficacy of LSG15 in most patients is transient. To prolong median survival time, additional therapies for maintenance of complete response (CR) are needed after achieving CR by induction chemotherapy. Improved outcome after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), despite a high incidence of graft-versus-host disease, has been reported. Thus, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and allogeneic peripheral blood SCT may have great potential for eradication of HTLV-1 and cure of ATL. Recently, reduced-intensity conditioning stem cell transplantation was also reported to be effective for ATL. Although several issues, including selection criteria for patients and sources of stem cells remain to be resolved, allo-SCT may be considered as a treatment option for patients with aggressive ATL. To evaluate whether allo-SCT is more effective than the standard chemotherapy (LSG15) for aggressive ATL, an up front phase II clinical trial of JCOG-LSG is now being planned. Novel innovative targeted strategies, such as antiretroviral therapy, arsenic trioxide, nuclear factor-kappaB inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, several monoclonal antibodies including anti-CC chemokine receptor 4, anti-folate, purine nucleotide phosphorylase inhibitor, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor, bendamustine, small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitors and Tax-targeted immunotherapy, should be promptly studied in order to develop curative treatments for ATL in the near future.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.3324/haematol.2022.281510,37300656

The preponderant acute manifestation is characterized by hypercalcemia, systemic manifestations, organomegaly, and dermatological eruptions. Conversely, the chronic phenotype is typified by lymphocytosis and/or cutaneous eruptions, while smoldering ATLL assumes an asymptomatic course. Immunocompromise afflicts ATLL patients, heightening their vulnerability to opportunistic infections that frequently intricately intertwine with disease progression. Therefore, an early diagnosis is crucial to manage the disease appropriately. While conventional chemotherapeutic regimens have shown limited success, especially in acute and lymphoma types, recent studies suggest that allogeneic stem cell transplantation might enhance treatment results because it has shown promising outcomes in some patients. Novel therapeutics, such as interferon and monoclonal antibodies, have also shown promise, but more research is needed to confirm their efficacy. Moreover, the identification of biomarkers for ATLL and genetic changes in HTLV-1 infected cells has led to the development of targeted therapies that have shown remarkable success in clinical trials. These targeted therapies have the potential to offer a more personalized approach to the treatment of ATLL.

ATL is clinically classified into four disease subtypes. The acute, lymphoma type, and cases of the chronic type involving unfavorable prognostic factors are regarded as aggressive ATL subtypes that require immediate treatment. Dose-intensified chemotherapy, such as the VCAP-AMP-VECP regimen, is considered to be the most recommended treatment for aggressive ATL. However, ATL remains difficult to cure and has an extremely poor prognosis, even when such chemotherapy is employed. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only known curative therapy and is recommended for younger patients with aggressive ATL. However, because of the increasing age at the onset of ATL, only a small fraction of patients with ATL can benefit from such transplants; therefore, there is an unmet medical need for novel drugs. Mogamulizumab, a defucosylated, humanized anti-C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) monoclonal antibody, was developed using a novel glycoengineering technique. Mogamulizumab monotherapy achieved clinically meaningful effects in patients with relapsed aggressive ATL and has exhibited acceptable toxicity profiles both inside and outside of Japan.

Here, we aimed to assess the anti-ATLL activities of ART and to elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms involved in this effect. Compared with uninfected T cells, HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines were sensitive to ART-induced cytotoxicity. ART caused cell cycle arrest at G<sub>1</sub> and/or G<sub>2</sub>/M phases, which was associated with decreased expression of cyclin dependent kinase 1/2/4/6, cyclin B1/D2/E and c-Myc, and increased expression of p21. ART-induced apoptosis corresponded to activation of caspase-8/9/3; decreased expression of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, myeloid cell leukemia-1, survivin, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1/2; and increased expression of Bak. ART increased intracellular reactive oxygen species and activation of the DNA damage marker γ-H2AX. Moreover, ART-induced cytotoxicity was partly reversed by treatment with a reactive oxygen species scavenger, iron chelator, and necroptosis or ferroptosis inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of caspase-dependent and -independent lethal pathways. These effects were correlated with inhibition of nuclear factor-κB and activator protein-1 signaling through dephosphorylation of IκBα, IκB kinase (IKK) α and IKKβ, and decreased expression of JunB and JunD.

Organomegaly, skin involvement, circulating atypical lymphocytes (""flower"" cells) with a CD4+ CD25+ phenotype and hypercalcaemia are the most common disease features. The diagnosis should be based on a constellation of clinical features and laboratory investigations. The latter comprise: lymphocyte morphology, immunophenotype, histology of the tissues affected in the pure lymphoma forms and serology or DNA analysis for HTLV-I. The differential diagnosis of ATLL includes other mature T-cell neoplasms such as T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), Sézary syndrome (SS), peripheral T-cell lymphomas and occasionally healthy carriers of the virus or Hodgkin disease. The clinical course is aggressive with a median survival of less than 12 months in the acute and lymphoma forms. Despite major advances in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease, management of these patients remains a challenge for clinicians as they do not respond or achieve only transient responses to therapies used in high-grade lymphomas. The use of antiretroviral agents such as zidovudine in combination with interferon-alpha, with or without concomitant chemotherapy, has shown activity in this disease with improvement in survival and response rate. Consolidation with high dose therapy and autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation should be considered in young patients.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.1002/hon.3115,34735653

Three decades of research in this field has resulted in accumulation of a wealth of knowledge about the molecular pathways underlying the proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T cells. Inappropriate over- and under-activation of various signaling pathways can contribute to pathological processes such as neoplasia. Molecular and pharmacological interventions that target the aberrant state of activation are thus of potential therapeutic benefit.

ATLL patients with aggressive subtypes have dismal outcomes. We demonstrate that ATLL cells co-opt an early checkpoint within the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) pathway, resulting in survival advantage. This early checkpoint revolves around an interaction between the deubiquitinase CYLD and its target RIPK1. The status of RIPK1 K63-ubiquitination determines cell fate by creating either a prosurvival signal (ubiquitinated RIPK1) or a death signal (deubiquitinated RIPK1). In primary ATLL samples and in cell line models, an increased baseline level of CYLD phosphorylation was observed. We therefore tested the hypothesis that this modification of CYLD, which has been reported to inhibit its deubiquitinating function, leads to increased RIPK1 ubiquitination and thus provides a prosurvival signal to ATLL cells. CYLD phosphorylation can be pharmacologically reversed by IKK inhibitors, specifically by TBK1/IKKε and IKKβ inhibitors (MRT67307 and TPCA). Both of the IKK sub-families can phosphorylate CYLD, and the combination of MRT67307 and TPCA have a marked effect in reducing CYLD phosphorylation and triggering cell death. ATLL cells overexpressing a kinase-inactive TBK1 (TBK1-K38A) demonstrate lower CYLD phosphorylation and subsequently reduced proliferation. IKK blockade reactivates CYLD, as evidenced by the reduction in RIPK1 ubiquitination, which leads to the association of RIPK1 with the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) to trigger cell death. In the absence of CYLD, RIPK1 ubiquitination remains elevated following IKK blockade and it does not associate with the DISC. SMAC mimetics can similarly disrupt CYLD phosphorylation and lead to ATLL cell death through reduction of RIPK1 ubiquitination, which is CYLD dependent. These results identify CYLD as a crucial regulator of ATLL survival and point to its role as a potential novel target for pharmacologic modification in this disease.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.3816/CLML.2010.n.084,34248128

In contrast, we observed that CADM1/TSLC1 is highly and ectopically expressed in all primary adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cells and in most human T-cell leukemia virus type (HTLV)-1-infected T-cell and ATLL cell lines. No expression, however, was detected in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells or in several other non-HTLV-1-infected leukemia cells. Moreover, we identified that high CADM1/TSLC1 expression plays an important role in enhanced cell-cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium, tumor growth and the ability of ATLL cells to infiltrate organs. We developed various antibodies as diagnostic tools to identify CADM1<sup>+</sup> ATLL cells. Using flow cytometry, we determined that CADM1/TSLC1 is present on the surface of ATLL cells. The percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CADM1<sup>+</sup> cells in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1 carriers and ATLL patients was highly correlated with the DNA copy number of HTLV-1 in lymphocytes.

Although the viral transactivating protein Tax has been proposed to play a critical role in leukemogeneis as shown by its transforming activity in various experimental systems, additional cellular events are required for the development of ATLL. One of the genetic events in ATLL is inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Among many candidates for tumor suppressor genes, the main genetic events have been reported to center around the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors ((CDKIs) p15INK4A, p16INK4B, p18INK4C, p19INK4D, p21WAF1, p27KIP1, and p57KIP2), p53 and Rb genes; all of them play a major regulatory role during G1 to S transition in the cell cycle. Acute/lymphomatous ATLL has frequent alterations of p15 (20%) and p16 (28-67%), while chronic/smoldering ATLL has fewer abnormalities of p15 (0-13%) and p16 (5-26%). Most of these changes are deletion of the genes; fewer samples have mutations. ATLL patients with deleted p15 and/or p16 genes have significantly shorter survival than those individuals with both genes preserved. Although genetic alterations of p18, p19, p21, p27 have rarely been reported, inactivation of these genes may contribute to the development of ATLL because low expression levels of these genes seem to mark ATLL. The p53 gene is mutated in 10-50% of acute/lymphomatous ATLL. Functional impairment of the p53 protein, even if the gene has wild-type sequences, has been suggested in HTLV-I infected cells. Each of these genetic events are mainly found in acute/lymphomatous ATLL, suggesting that alterations of these genes may be associated with transformation to an aggressive phenotype. The Rb tumor suppressor gene is infrequently structurally altered, but one half of ATLL cases have lost expression of this key protein. Notably, alterations of one of the CDKIs, p53 and Rb genes appear to obviate the need for inactivation of other genes in the same pathway. A novel tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 6q may also have a critical role in the pathogenesis of ATLL. Taken together, tumor suppressor genes are frequently altered in acute/lymphomatous ATLL and their alteration is probably the driving force fueling the transition from chronic/smoldering to acute/lymphomatous ATLL.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.3960/jslrt.20058,31698427

The diversity in clinical features and prognosis of patients with this disease has led to its subclassification into the following four categories: acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The chronic and smoldering subtypes are considered indolent and are usually managed with watchful waiting until disease progression, analogous to the management of some patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or other indolent histology lymphomas. Patients with aggressive ATL generally have a poor prognosis because of multidrug resistance of malignant cells, a large tumor burden with multiorgan failure, hypercalcemia, and/or frequent infectious complications as a result of a profound T-cell immunodeficiency. Under the sponsorship of the 13th International Conference on Human Retrovirology: HTLV, a group of ATL researchers joined to form a consensus statement based on established data to define prognostic factors, clinical subclassifications, and treatment strategies. A set of response criteria specific for ATL reflecting a combination of those for lymphoma and CLL was proposed. Clinical subclassification is useful but is limited because of the diverse prognosis among each subtype. Molecular abnormalities within the host genome, such as tumor suppressor genes, may account for these diversities. A treatment strategy based on the clinical subclassification and prognostic factors is suggested, including watchful waiting approach, chemotherapy, antiviral therapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (alloHSCT), and targeted therapies.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.2169/internalmedicine.5077-20,33950540

The first human retrovirus HTLV-I (human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I) is considered to be related to its aetiology. In ATL endemic areas, HTLV-I carriers form a fairly high percentage of the population, even among healthy individuals. ATL shows diverse clinical features. It can be divided into four subtypes: acute, chronic, smouldering and lymphoma type. ATL cells originate from the CD4-positive subset of peripheral T cells; they show a characteristic notch in the nucleus and a tendency to lobulation. ATL resists chemotherapy, and patients with acute and lymphoma types have a fairly poor prognosis. A definite diagnosis of ATL is made by documenting the presence of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the DNA of tumour cells. HTLV-I infection is caused by transmission of live lymphocytes via three routes (from mother to child, from males to females, and by transfusion). Familial occurrence of ATL is frequently seen. HTLV-I infection is seen in other countries, but its incidence is highest in Japan. Infection with HTLV-I is a direct cause of ATL. Furthermore, infection with this virus can indirectly cause many other diseases via the induction of immunodeficiency, such as chronic lung disease, opportunistic lung infection, cancer of other organs, monoclonal gammopathy, chronic renal failure, strongyloidiasis, non-specific dermatomycosis, HTLV-I-associated lymphadenitis, HTLV-I uveitis and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy-tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.1182/bloodadvances.2022007725,31889601

Patients with ATLL frequently develop humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) resulting from increased osteoclastic bone resorption. Our goal was to investigate the mechanisms of ATLL-induced osteoclastic bone resorption. Murine calvaria co-cultured with HTLV-1-infected cells directly or conditioned media from cell cultures had increased osteoclast activity that was dependent on RANKL, indicating that factors secreted from ATLL cells had a stimulatory effect on bone resorption. Factors released from resorbing bone stimulated proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), both osteoclast stimulators, were expressed in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Interestingly, when HTLV-1-infected T-cells were co-cultured with pre-osteoblasts, the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG), an osteoclast inhibitory factor, was significantly down-regulated in the pre-osteoblasts. When OPG was added into the ex vivo osteoclastogenesis assay induced by HTLV-1-infected T-cells, osteoclastogenesis was strongly inhibited. In addition, HTLV-1-infected T-cells inhibited expression of early osteoblast genes and induced late genes. These regulators will serve as future therapeutic targets for the treatments of HHM in ATLL.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.1016/j.semcancer.2013.11.003,23912346

Ten years of work on HTLV-1-associated diseases in an endemic region of Iran have been critically compared in the present study. The outstanding findings of RNA-seq, system biology analysis, and gene expression measurements on adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and enzootic bovine leukosis(EBL) in our lab encouraged us to investigate the significant role of oncogenes in the ATLL malignancy. Most studies assessed such interactions by the proviral load (PVL), Tax, and HBZ regulatory proteins in HTLV-1 and the host's immunological and cell cycle factors. The current study is a comprehensive comparing view of our previously published and unpublished results investigating the HTLV-1-host interactions leading to the transformation of the infected cell. The main focus has been on the essential proteins implicated in the virus dissemination, cell survival, and proliferation of infected cells toward leukemia development and progression. Similar to its homolog BLV-AS-1-2 in EBL, the HTLV-1-HBZ is a pivotal factor in the maintenance and progression of the ATLL. In addition, the inappropriate activities of the PI3K/Akt pathway, BRCAs, and RAD51 in the DNA repair system, which are orchestrating many other immortalization pathways, might be the central factors in the manifestation of ATLL.

Although the process of clonal evolution of ATL cells may involve multiple steps, ATL cells from half of the ATL cases still retain the ability to express HTLV-I Tax, a key molecule of HTLV-I leukemogenesis. A recent finding of reactivation of Tax-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in ATL patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation suggests the presence of Tax expression in vivo and potential contribution of the CTL to antitumor immunity. This is consistent with the results of a series of animal experiments indicating that Tax-specific CTL limit the growth of HTLV-I-infected cells in vivo, although the animal model mimics only an early phase of HTLV-I infection and leukemogenesis. Establishment of an insufficient HTLV-I-specific T-cell response and an increased viral load in orally HTLV-I-infected rats suggests that host HTLV-I-specific T-cell response at a primary HTLV-I infection can be a critical determinant of persistent HTLV-I levels thereafter.

Furthermore, the effects of rigosertib, wortmannin, and rapamycin on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to inhibit the proliferation of ATLL cells were examined. The results showed that mRNA expression of Akt/PI3K/mTOR was down-regulated in carrier, HAM/TSP, and ATLL patients, as well as MT-2, and Inf-3T3 cells, compared to the healthy individuals and untreated MT-2 and Inf-3T3 as controls. However, western blotting revealed an increase in the phosphorylated and activated forms of AKT and mTOR. Treating the cells with rapamycin, wortmannin, and rigosertib decreased the phosphorylated forms of Akt and mTOR and restored their mRNA expression levels. Using these inhibitors also significantly boosted the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as well as the expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in the MT-2 and Inf-3T3cells. Rigosertib was more potent than wortmannin and rapamycin in inducing sub-G1 and G2-M cell cycle arrest, as well as late apoptosis in the Inf-3T3 and MT-2 cells. It also synergized the cytotoxic effects of vincristine. These findings demonstrate that HTLV-1 downregulation of the mRNA level may occur as a negative feedback response to increased PI3K-Akt-mTOR phosphorylation by HTLV-1. Therefore, using rigosertib alone or in combination with common chemotherapy drugs may be beneficial in ATLL patients.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2023 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>",10.1159/000534040,16444967

However, in primary ATL cells, although expression of the virus, including the Tax oncoprotein, appears just after an in vitro culture, integration sites of the provirus into the host genome are random, and chromosomal/genetic abnormalities are complex. ATL is thus a single disease entity that is caused by HTLV-1 and possesses diverse molecular features. The clinical features and prognosis of ATL vary, and this has led to subtypes classified into four categories: acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering types, based on lactate dehydrogenase and calcium values and organ involvement. Approximately 15 to 20 million individuals are infected with HTLV-1 worldwide, 1.1 million of whom reside in Japan, and the annual incidence of ATL has been estimated to be approximately 1,000. HTLV-1 infection early in life, mainly from breast feeding, is crucial for the development of ATL. The age-specific occurrence of ATL and complex genome abnormalities that accumulate with disease progression suggest a multistep carcinogenesis model following HTLV-1 infection.

HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus infecting approximately 10-20 million people worldwide, particularly in southern and southeastern Japan, the Caribbean, highlands of South America, Melanesia, and Equatorial Africa. Despite this high frequency of human infection, only 2-5 % of HTLV-1-infected individuals develop ATLL. Three major routes of viral transmission have been established: (1) mother-to-child transmission through breast-feeding; (2) sexual transmission, predominantly from men to women; and (3) cellular blood components. Multiple factors (e.g., virus, host cell, and immune factors) have been implicated in the development of ATLL, although the underlying mechanisms of leukemogenesis have not been fully elucidated. No preventive vaccine against HTLV-1 is currently available, and interrupting the well-recognized primary modes of HTLV-1 transmission is the mainstay of ATLL prevention.

During the carrier state, infected cells are selected in vivo by the host's immune system, the genetic and epigenetic environment of proviral integration sites, and other factors. In leukemic cells, tax gene expression is frequently impaired by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Such loss of Tax expression enables ATL cells to escape the host immune system. On the other hand, ATL cells acquire the ability to proliferate without Tax by intracellular genetic and epigenetic changes. Despite advances in support and the development of novel treatment agents, the prognosis for ATLL remains poor. A number of therapies, however, do appear to improve prognosis compared to CHOP (VEPA). These include interferon-alpha plus zidovudine (probably after 1-2 cycles of CHOP), intensive chemotherapy as in LSG-15 with G-CSF support and Allo-SCT (which includes the potential for cure). Emerging novel approaches include HDAC inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and proteasome inhibitors. Comparison between different therapeutic approaches is complicated by the range of natural history of ATLL, different recruitments of naïve-to-therapy, refractory or relapsed patients, and variations in the reporting of outcome that frequently excludes difficult-to-evaluate patients. Moreover, results from relatively small proof-of-principle studies have not been extended with randomized, controlled trials. As a result, currently, there is no clear evidence to support the value of any particular treatment approach over others. To avoid further unnecessary patient suffering and to identify optimal therapy as rapidly as possible, large randomized, controlled trials encompassing multicenter, international collaborations will be necessary.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.1007/s12185-022-03447-0,26635405
94,<ArticleTitle>[Progress in the management of ATL].</ArticleTitle>,"<Abstract><AbstractText>Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a peripheral T-cell malignancy caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1). Between 3% and 5% of HTLV-1-infected individuals develop ATL after a long latency. Confirmation of seropositivity of anti-HTLV-1 antibody, and clonal proliferation of CD4 and CD25 positive lymphocytes with nuclear pleomorphism in patients suspicious of malignant lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia is crucial for the diagnosis of ATL. The clinical course of ATL is very heterogeneous, and divided into acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The chronic type is further subclassified into the favorable and unfavorable subtypes. Acute, lymphoma, and unfavorable chronic type ATL, and favorable chronic and smoldering type ATL are defined as aggressive and indolent ATL, respectively. Recently identified prognostic indices based on clinical parameters and/or genetic predictors of outcomes need to be confirmed and incorporated for more stratified therapeutic interventions. The standard of care for aggressive ATL is multiagent chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation if possible, while that for indolent ATL is watchful waiting until progression to aggressive ATL. The combination of interferon-α and zidovudine is also standard for leukemic type ATL. In addition, mogamulizumab, lenalidomide, and brentuximab vedotin have been incorporated into clinical practices in Japan. Furthermore, several novel drugs are currently undergoing clinical trials.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

In flow cytometric analysis, the percentages of CD4(+)CADM1(+) double-positive cells correlated well with both the percentages of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells and with abnormal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with various types of ATLL. Moreover, the degree of CD4(+)CADM1(+) cells over 1% significantly correlated with the copy number of the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) provirus in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1 carriers and ATLL patients. We also identified a soluble form of CADM1 in the peripheral blood of ATLL patients, and the expression levels of this form were correlated with the levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptor alpha. Moreover, lymphomas derived from ATLL were strongly and specifically stained with a CADM1 antibody. Thus, detection of CD4(+)CADM1(+) cells in the peripheral blood, measurement of serum levels of soluble CADM1 and immunohistochemical detection of CADM1 in lymphomas would be a useful set of markers for disease progression in ATLL and may aid in both the early diagnosis and measurement of treatment efficacy for ATLL.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.1371/journal.pone.0256320,34385616

To illuminate the pathogenesis of ATLL we performed whole transcriptome sequencing of purified ATLL patient samples and discovered recurrent somatic mutations in CCR4, encoding CC chemokine receptor 4. CCR4 mutations were detected in 14/53 ATLL samples (26%) and consisted exclusively of nonsense or frameshift mutations that truncated the coding region at C329, Q330, or Y331 in the carboxy terminus. Functionally, the CCR4-Q330 nonsense isoform was gain-of-function because it increased cell migration toward the CCR4 ligands CCL17 and CCL22, in part by impairing receptor internalization. This mutant enhanced PI(3) kinase/AKT activation after receptor engagement by CCL22 in ATLL cells and conferred a growth advantage in long-term in vitro cultures. These findings implicate somatic gain-of-function CCR4 mutations in the pathogenesis of ATLL and suggest that inhibition of CCR4 signaling might have therapeutic potential in this refractory malignancy.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.1007/s12185-020-02939-1,32641657

Cardiac involvement in patients with ATLL is infrequent, and when it happens it is usually seen in aggressive ATLL subtypes. However, ATLL presenting as isolated cardiac valve involvement is extremely rare. To date, only three histologically proven cases of ATLL with isolated cardiac valve involvement have been reported. Herein, we describe a 61-year-old Peruvian man who presented heart failure symptoms secondary to progressive cardiac valve infiltration. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis. Histopathological evaluation of the resected valve revealed leaflet thickening with a nodular appearance due to fibrous tissue containing atypical T-lymphocytes with Foxp3 expression, infiltrating all layers of the resected valve. Interestingly, tumor cells were distributed around an incidental venous malformation (i.e., cavernous hemangioma). Postoperative evaluation demonstrated positive serology for HTLV-1, and a diagnosis of ATLL was established. Postoperative positron emission tomography/computed tomography did not show lesions outside the heart and cell blood counts were within normal range with low level of circulating CD4+ CD25+ lymphoma cell counts (7%); therefore, patient's disease was considered as smoldering ATLL and a ""watch and wait"" strategy was pursued. Currently, the patient is alive with no progression of disease after 18 months from diagnosis. Isolated cardiac valve involvement by ATLL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of HTLV-1 carriers with progressive heart failure, even when systemic lymphoma involvement is absent or not apparent.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) has no effective therapy and high levels of cell surface transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) expression have been reported in ATLL by us and other groups. In this study, to develop a novel molecular-targeted therapy against TFR1 to modulate iron metabolism, we initially determined the expression pattern of several iron-related genes along with TFR1 and found that ATLL cells presented characteristic of an iron-deficiency state such as high expression of iron-regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) and low expression of its E3 ubiquitin-ligase, FBXL5. Therefore, we developed human IgG monoclonal antibodies to human TFR1 using a phage display method (ICOS method) to block the incorporation of the transferrin (TF)-iron complex into ATLL cells for inhibiting cell growth. One of the mAbs, JST-TFR09, presented its greater affinity to TFR1 on ATLL cells in flow cytometry (FCM) analysis than those of commercially available anti-TFR1 antibodies and identified high expression of TFR1 in most of the acute-type ATLL cells. Moreover, JST-TFR09 could interfere with binding between TFR1 and TF, which resulted in effective blockade of TFR1 internalization and induction of cell apoptosis by the treatment of ATLL cells with JST-TFR09. JST-TFR09 showed dual activities through direct cell cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and the treatment of JST-TFR09 significantly suppressed cell growth of ATLL cells with induction of apoptosis in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Thus, JST-TFR09 described here may become a promising therapeutic antibody for the treatment of ATLL.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Most ATLL patients fare poorly with conventional chemotherapy; however, antiviral therapy with zidovudine (AZT) and interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) has produced long-term clinical remissions. We studied primary ATLL tumors and identified molecular features linked to sensitivity and resistance to antiviral therapy. Enhanced expression of the proto-oncogene c-Rel was noted in 9 of 27 tumors. Resistant tumors exhibited c-Rel (6 of 10; 60%) more often than did sensitive variants (1 of 9; 11%). This finding was independent of the disease form. Elevated expression of the putative c-Rel target, interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF-4), was observed in 10 (91%) of 11 nonresponders and in all tested patients with c-Rel+ tumors and occurred in the absence of the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax. In contrast, tumors in complete responders did not express c-Rel or IRF-4. Gene rearrangement studies demonstrated the persistence of circulating T-cell clones in long-term survivors maintained on antiviral therapy. The expression of nuclear c-Rel and IRF-4 occurs in the absence of Tax in primary ATLL and is associated with antiviral resistance. These molecular features may help guide treatment. AZT and IFN-alpha is a suppressive rather than a curative regimen, and patients in clinical remission should remain on maintenance therapy indefinitely.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.5070/D327955137,18164760

We performed a comprehensive search of the medical literature using PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane reviews on September 10, 2018. We extracted data on clinical outcomes related to benefits (complete response [CR], overall survival [OS], and progression-free survival [PFS]) and harms (relapse and nonrelapse mortality [NRM]), independently by 2 authors. Our search strategy identified a total of 801 references. Nineteen studies (n = 2446 patients) were included in the systematic review; however, only 18 studies (n = 1767 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Reduced intensity conditioning regimens were more commonly prescribed (52%). Bone marrow (50%) and peripheral blood (40%) were more frequently used as stem cell source. The pooled post-allografting CR, OS, and PFS rates were 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57% to 87%), 40% (95% CI, 33% to 46%), and 37% (95% CI, 27% to 48%), respectively.

After treatment with MOG, leukemic cells in the peripheral blood rapidly disappeared, and the skin, lymph node, and lung lesions gradually regressed.

An important mechanism of the activated NF-κB signaling pathway in ATLL is the activation of the macroautophagy (herafter referred to as autophagy in the remainder of this manuscript)-lysosomal degradation of p47 (NSFL1C), a negative regulator of the NF-κB pathway. Therefore, we considered the use of chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (CQ/HCQ) as an autophagy inhibitor to treat ATLL; these drugs were originally approved by the FDA as antimalarial drugs and have recently been used to treat autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In this paper, we determined the therapeutic efficacy of CQ/HCQ, as NF-κB inhibitors, in ATLL mediated by blockade of p47 degradation. Administration of CQ/HCQ to ATLL cell lines and primary ATLL cells induced cell growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner, and the majority of cells underwent apoptosis after CQ administration. As to the molecular mechanism, autophagy was inhibited in CQ-treated ATLL cells, and activation of the NF-κB pathway was suppressed with the restoration of the p47 level. When the antitumor effect of CQ/HCQ was examined using immunodeficient mice transplanted with ATLL cell lines, CQ/HCQ significantly suppressed tumor growth and improved the survival rate in the ATLL xenograft mouse model. Importantly, HCQ selectively induced ATLL cell death in the ATLL xenograft mouse model at the dose used to treat SLE. Taken together, our results suggest that the inhibition of autophagy by CQ/HCQ may become a novel and effective strategy for the treatment of ATLL.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.1200/JCO.2011.35.5578,15160945

We performed immunohistochemical analysis for CD25, Foxp3, and CD30 on samples from 42 US/Caribbean ATLL patients and correlated these markers with morphologic subtype and clinical characteristics. In the 16/42 patients who had successive biopsies, we determined the expression stability of these markers. Foxp3 was expressed in 26 of the 42 (62%) initial biopsies, and its intensity correlated with CD25 expression. It was more frequent in pleomorphic small-sized and medium-sized cell types than in large cell tumors but did not correlate with patients' clinical attributes. Foxp3 expression and morphology were unchanged in successive biopsies in 13 of 16 patients. Four initial biopsies had features of anaplastic large cell T lymphomas, all of which were Foxp3. Successive biopsies from 2 patients with pleomorphic medium cell variant showed diminishing expression of originally weak Foxp3 expression and de novo CD30 expression, whereas they showed morphologic progression to the anaplastic cell variant. A third patient's second biopsy revealed progression from pleomorphic medium to anaplastic large cell morphology with loss of Foxp3, but it remained CD30. Foxp3 expression correlates with pleomorphic small and medium cell types and may be lost with large cell transformation. The evolution of the latter type can be associated with the gain of CD30 expression; such ATLL tumors might respond to anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody therapies.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.1111/bjh.15744,31610149

We report a rare case of primary adrenal adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (primary adrenal ATLL). ATLL is a highly aggressive T-cell type non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and etiologically associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1). Most ATLL patients present with leukemia and widespread lymphadenopathy. A 37-year-old Japanese woman presented with back pain in January 2004. Examination showed no peripheral lymphadenopathy, circulating lymphoma cells, hepatosplenomegaly, and skin lesions. Imaging studies demonstrated large adrenal masses bilaterally. Subsequently, she underwent open adrenal biopsy and pathological diagnosis was confirmed as T-cell lymphoma. The serum antibody to HTLV-1 was positive. Southern blot analysis detected monoclonal integration of proviral DNA of HTLV-1 into host genome in the biopsy specimen. The diagnosis of ATLL arising in adrenal glands was established. Despite repeated systemic chemotherapy, the patient died of progressive disease in December 2004. ATLL could primarily involve the adrenal gland and this disease entity should be included in the differential diagnosis of adrenal mass lesions.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.1080/10428194.2021.1984455,20887496

Here, we have explored the possible expression of cancer/testis (CT) antigens by ATLL cells, as CT antigens are widely recognized as ideal targets of cancer immunotherapy against solid tumors. A high percentage (87.7%) of ATLL cases (n = 57) expressed CT antigens at the mRNA level: NY-ESO-1 (61.4%), MAGE-A3 (31.6%), and MAGE-A4 (61.4%). CT antigen expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. This contrasts with other types of lymphoma or leukemia, which scarcely express these CT antigens. Humoral immune responses, particularly against NY-ESO-1, were detected in 11.6% (5 of 43) and NY-ESO-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses were observed in 55.6% (5 of 9) of ATLL patients. NY-ESO-1-specific CD8(+) T cells recognized autologous ATLL cells and produced effector cytokines. Thus, ATLL cells characteristically express CT antigens and therefore vaccination with CT antigens can be an effective immunotherapy of ATLL.</AbstractText></Abstract>",10.1016/j.bbmt.2014.12.020,33559154

ATL relapses within a short period despite its transient response to multiagent chemotherapy and the prognosis is extremely poor due to anticancer drug resistance and immunodeficiency. Although novel agents with different mechanisms, such as molecular targeted agents, have improved the prognosis, the number of cured patients remains limited. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation resulted in long-term remission, whereas its indication is limited due to treatment-related mortality. As most ATL patients are of advanced age, development of a lesser toxic treatment is necessary. Therefore, we developed a novel therapeutic dendritic cell vaccine targeting the HTLV-1 Tax antigen. The safety profile has been confirmed in a pilot and phase I clinical studies, and a promising long-term clinical efficacy has also been obtained. This novel vaccine is a noninvasive, long-lasting therapy for ATL and can potentially be extended to different applications for low-grade ATL and high-risk HTLV-1 carriers.</AbstractText></Abstract>",,16106073

Herein, we determined the effect of butein, a bioactive plant polyphenol, on cell growth, apoptosis and signaling pathways in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and on tumor growth in SCID mice. Treatment with butein caused a decrease in viability of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. T cells cultured with butein showed obvious apoptosis morphology, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase with activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9. Pretreatment of cells with caspase inhibitor partially blocked butein-induced inhibition of cell viability. Butein also resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Butein markedly downregulated the protein expression levels of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin E, survivin, XIAP, c-IAP2 and phospho-pRb. Butein also inhibited i) total and phospho-protein levels of IκB kinase (IKK)α and IKKβ, ii) degradation and phosphorylation of IκBα, iii) JunB and JunD, iv) total and phospho-protein levels of Akt, v) phosphorylation of RelA, vi) heat shock protein 90, and vii) DNA-binding activity of NF-κB and AP-1. In mice harboring ATLL xenograft tumors, butein caused a significant inhibition of tumor growth and reduced serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor α chain and soluble cluster of differentiation 30. Considered together, the results indicated that butein has antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties through the suppression of NF-κB, AP-1 and Akt signaling in HTLV-1-infected T cells, both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting its therapeutic potential against HTLV-1-associated diseases including ATLL.</AbstractText></Abstract>",,34407152

Patients with aggressive ATL show dismal prognoses, even with intensive dose-dense chemotherapy. Such patients often show chemo-refractoriness. Mogamulizumab (Moga) is a potent treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory ATL. However, use of Moga before allo-HSCT could theoretically increase the risk of post-transplant complications like graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as Moga depletes regulatory T-cells (Tregs). We retrospectively assessed the impact of Moga on post-transplant outcomes using data from a nationwide survey. Pre-transplant administration of Moga was associated with an increased risk of grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD and refractoriness to systemic corticosteroid for acute GVHD. The one-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was significantly higher in patients who were treated with Moga pre-transplant compared with those who were not (43.7% vs. 25.1%, P&lt;0.01). The probability of one-year overall survival was also significantly lower in patients with pre-transplant Moga use compared to those without (32.3% vs. 49.4%, P&lt;0.01). In summary, pre-transplant Moga was significantly associated with an increased risk of GVHD-related mortality, which supports the relevance of CCR4-expressing Tregs after allo-HSCT in humans.</AbstractText></Abstract>",,23947237

She had chronic refractory eczema and corneal injury at the onset of ATLL. Remission of ATLL was achieved, and the HTLV-1 proviral load decreased after HSCT. In addition, her pre-existing eczema and corneal injuries almost disappeared. More than a year has passed since the transplantation was performed, and she has had no recurrence of either ATLL or lesions in the skin and eye.

This oncoretrovirus can be transmitted through 3 ways: horizontally, vertically (mother to child) and via blood transfusion. HTLV-1 causes 2 major diseases: adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy. Tax is a 40-kDa phosphoprotein that is encoded by the pX region of the virus. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated a central role for this protein in the immortalization or transformation of the HTLV-1 infected cells. Apart from its ability to drive transcription from the viral promoter, it also deregulates the cell cycle, inhibits apoptosis, has an effect on the maintenance of the genomic stability and induces the production of several cytokines. In addition, several arguments strongly suggest the existence of host genetic factors, that could be involved in the HTLV-1 infection as well as in the development of ATLL among HTLV-1 infected individuals. ATLL can be classified into 4 major subtypes: a smoldering type, a chronic type, a lymphoma type and a leukemic type. The demonstration by Southern blot analysis of the clonal integration of an HTLV-1 provirus in the tumoral cells represents the gold-standard to define biologically ATLL. The survival rate of ATLL patients, especially those who develop the acute leukemic or lymphomas forms, is very poor, and such clonal malignant CD4 expansion remains one of the most severe lymphoproliferations.</AbstractText></Abstract>",,32157421

Despite extensive studies on ATLL development and progression, the fundamental processes of HTLV-1 oncogenicity are yet to be understood. This study aimed to integrate high-throughput microarray datasets to find novel genes involved in the mechanism of ATLL progression. For this purpose, five microarray datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and then profoundly analyzed. Differentially expressed genes and miRNAs were determined using the MetaDE package in the R software and the GEO2R web tool. The STRING database was utilized to construct the protein-protein interaction network and explore hub genes. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis were carried out by employing the EnrichR web tool. Furthermore, flow cytometry was employed to assess the CD4/CD8 ratio, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to confirm the high-throughput data analysis results. Four miRNAs, including hsa-mir-146, hsa-mir-451, hsa-mir-31, and hsa-mir-125, were among the statistically significant differentially expressed miRNAs between healthy individuals and ATLL patients. Moreover, 924 differentially expressed genes were identified between normal and ATLL samples. Further network analysis highlighted 59 hub genes mainly regulating pathways implicated in viral interferences, immunological processes, cancer, and apoptosis pathways. Among the identified hub genes, RhoA and PRKACB were most considerable in the high-throughput analysis and were further validated by qRT-PCR. The RhoA and PRKACB expression were significantly down-regulated in ATLL patients compared to asymptomatic carriers (p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.004) and healthy subjects (p=0.043 and p=0.002). Therefore, these corresponding miRNAs and proteins could be targeted for diagnosis purposes and designing effective treatments.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022.
